ABSTRACT = {Millimeter-wave radar has demonstrated its high efficiency in complex environments in recent years, which outperforms LiDAR and computer vision in human activity recognition in the presence of smoke, fog, and dust. In previous studies, researchers mostly analyzed either 2D (3D) point cloud or range&ndash;Doppler information from radar echo to extract activity features. In this paper, we propose a multi-model deep learning approach to fuse the features of both point clouds and range&ndash;Doppler for classifying six activities, i.e., boxing, jumping, squatting, walking, circling, and high-knee lifting, based on a millimeter-wave radar. We adopt a CNN&ndash;LSTM model to extract the time-serial features from point clouds and a CNN model to obtain the features from range&ndash;Doppler. Then we fuse the two features and input the fused feature into the full connected layer for classification. We built a dataset based on a 3D millimeter-wave radar from 17 volunteers. The evaluation result based on the dataset shows that this method has higher accuracy than utilizing the two kinds of information separately and achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.26%, which is about 1% higher than other networks with only one kind of data as input.},
