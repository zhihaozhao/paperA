### 2.1 WiFi CSI-based Human Activity Recognition

```latex
WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising modality for device-free human activity recognition due to its ubiquity and privacy-preserving nature. Early approaches relied on handcrafted features and traditional machine learning classifiers, but recent advances have embraced deep learning architectures.

\textbf{Deep Learning Approaches:} Recent works have explored various neural architectures for CSI-based HAR. \cite{rewis2022} proposed ReWiS, a few-shot learning framework that achieves 35\% improvement in cross-environment performance compared to standard CNNs, with accuracy degradation below 10\% in new environments. \cite{autofi2022} introduced AutoFi, leveraging geometric self-supervised learning from unlabeled CSI samples to reduce annotation requirements. For multimodal sensing, \cite{gaitfi2022} combined WiFi and vision data through lightweight residual convolution networks (LRCN), achieving 94.2\% accuracy in human identification tasks.

\textbf{Efficiency and Scalability:} To address deployment challenges, \cite{efficientfi2022} proposed EfficientFi, achieving 1784× compression ratio while maintaining 98\%+ accuracy through joint compression-sensing optimization. Similarly, \cite{clnet2021} designed complex-input lightweight networks with attention mechanisms, reducing computational cost by 24.1\% while improving accuracy by 5.41\%.
```

### 2.2 Cross-Domain Generalization in WiFi Sensing

```latex
Domain shift remains a critical challenge in WiFi sensing systems, as CSI patterns vary significantly across environments, devices, and users. Existing approaches can be categorized into domain adaptation and domain generalization strategies.

\textbf{Domain Adaptation:} \cite{fewsense2022} proposed FewSense, achieving cross-domain performance of 90.3\%, 96.5\%, and 82.7\% on SignFi, Widar, and Wiar datasets respectively using 5-shot learning. The approach requires few labeled samples in the target domain for fine-tuning.

\textbf{Domain Generalization:} \cite{airfi2022} introduced AirFi, learning environment-invariant features during training to generalize to unseen domains without requiring target domain data. However, these methods primarily focus on accuracy metrics without considering model calibration or trustworthiness.

\textbf{Limitations:} While existing cross-domain methods show promising accuracy improvements, they lack systematic evaluation protocols for calibration, reliability, and statistical significance testing that are crucial for real-world deployment.
```

### 2.3 Trustworthy Machine Learning in Sensing

```latex
Beyond accuracy, trustworthy deployment of sensing systems requires proper uncertainty quantification and calibration assessment. However, most WiFi sensing literature focuses primarily on classification accuracy.

\textbf{Calibration Gap:} Existing WiFi CSI methods \cite{rewis2022, autofi2022, gaitfi2022} report accuracy metrics but rarely evaluate Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier scores, or reliability curves. This limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios where confidence estimation is crucial.

\textbf{Evaluation Protocols:} Current evaluation practices often use simple train-test splits without rigorous cross-validation protocols like Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) or Leave-One-Room-Out (LORO) that better simulate real-world domain shift scenarios.
```

### 2.4 Synthetic Data and Sim2Real Transfer

```latex
Synthetic data generation has shown promise in computer vision and robotics, but its application in WiFi sensing remains underexplored, particularly for systematic Sim2Real analysis.

\textbf{Limited Synthetic Evaluation:} While some works use simulated CSI data, none provide controllable physics-based generators that enable causal analysis between difficulty factors (e.g., class overlap, noise levels) and model performance.

\textbf{Label Efficiency Gap:} Unlike computer vision where Sim2Real transfer and label efficiency are well-studied \cite{domain_adaptation_survey}, WiFi sensing lacks systematic analysis of how synthetic pretraining affects few-shot learning performance in real scenarios.
