\begin{abstract}

Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Channel State Information (CSI) based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has shown promising results, but practical deployment is hindered by the scarcity of labeled real-world data and poor cross-domain generalization. While existing benchmarks like SenseFi systematically evaluate models on real datasets, they require abundant labeled data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We propose a novel physics-guided synthetic CSI data generation framework that addresses this fundamental challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning. Our approach models the underlying WiFi signal propagation physics, incorporating key factors such as multipath effects, environmental variations, and human body interactions to generate realistic synthetic CSI data. We introduce an enhanced deep learning architecture with squeeze-and-excitation modules and temporal attention mechanisms, coupled with trustworthy evaluation protocols including calibration analysis and reliability assessment. Comprehensive experiments including systematic synthetic data validation (D2 protocol: 540 configurations), cross-domain adaptation evaluation (CDAE protocol: 40 configurations), and Sim2Real transfer efficiency assessment (STEA protocol: 56 configurations) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our method achieves 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, representing merely a 1.2\% gap compared to full supervision while reducing labeling costs by 80\%. The Enhanced model demonstrates exceptional cross-domain consistency, achieving identical 83.0±0.1\% F1 performance across both leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) and leave-one-room-out (LORO) protocols with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$). This work represents the first systematic Sim2Real study in WiFi CSI HAR, offering a practical solution to the data scarcity challenge in ubiquitous sensing applications.

\section{Introduction}

Recent trends in ubiquitous computing and Internet-of-Things deployment have raised significant concerns about the practical viability of device-free sensing systems, particularly regarding their dependence on extensive labeled datasets and their vulnerability to cross-domain performance degradation. The phenomenon of wireless signal-based human activity recognition has intrigued researchers for decades due to its inherent complexity arising from multipath propagation, environmental sensitivity, and the intricate relationship between human motion dynamics and electromagnetic wave perturbations. This complexity manifests as a fundamental tension between the promise of privacy-preserving, infrastructure-leveraging sensing capabilities and the harsh realities of deployment in diverse, uncontrolled environments where labeled training data is prohibitively expensive to obtain.

The central research question that motivates this investigation concerns whether physics-guided synthetic data generation can bridge the gap between laboratory-controlled WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) human activity recognition systems and their practical deployment in real-world scenarios characterized by data scarcity and domain heterogeneity.

Existing benchmarking efforts have made substantial contributions to the field, with SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} providing the most comprehensive systematic evaluation by comparing 11 deep learning models across 4 public datasets, thereby establishing standardized evaluation protocols and revealing significant performance variations across different architectures and datasets. However, these valuable benchmarking studies operate under the fundamental assumption that abundant labeled real-world training data is readily available, which creates a substantial gap between research achievements and practical deployment scenarios. While prior research has explored various sophisticated approaches including transfer learning methodologies, domain adaptation techniques, and data augmentation strategies, these approaches still fundamentally depend on the availability of sufficient target-domain labeled data, leaving the core challenge of data scarcity largely unaddressed. Furthermore, current evaluation practices predominantly emphasize accuracy metrics while neglecting critical aspects of model reliability, calibration quality, and trustworthiness that are essential for safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring and elderly care systems.

Our work addresses these limitations through several novel contributions that advance both the theoretical understanding and practical applicability of WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition. We introduce a physics-guided synthetic data generation framework that models the underlying electromagnetic propagation principles, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic CSI data that captures essential real-world characteristics including multipath effects, environmental variations, and human-signal interactions. We demonstrate the first systematic simulation-to-reality transfer learning study in WiFi CSI HAR, showing that models pre-trained on synthetic data require only 20% real data for fine-tuning to achieve 82.1% macro F1 score, representing 98.6% of full-dataset performance while reducing data collection costs by 80%. Additionally, we propose an enhanced deep learning architecture incorporating squeeze-and-excitation modules and temporal attention mechanisms that achieves unprecedented cross-domain consistency with identical 83.0±0.1% F1 performance across both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-room-out protocols. We acknowledge that our approach has limitations, particularly in handling complex multi-person scenarios and dynamic environmental conditions, and we recognize that the synthetic data generation framework, while physics-guided, may not capture all nuances of real-world signal propagation, necessitating future research into more sophisticated modeling approaches.

The remainder of this paper is structured to provide comprehensive coverage of our methodology and findings. Section II reviews related work in WiFi CSI human activity recognition, synthetic data generation approaches, and simulation-to-reality transfer learning techniques, positioning our contributions within the broader research landscape. Section III presents our physics-guided synthetic data generation framework, detailing the underlying propagation models and parameterization strategies that enable realistic CSI simulation. Section IV describes our enhanced model architecture incorporating attention mechanisms and our trustworthy evaluation protocols that assess both accuracy and calibration quality. Section V presents comprehensive experimental results across three systematic evaluation protocols, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach through rigorous cross-domain and transfer learning assessments. Section VI provides an in-depth discussion of our findings, their implications for the field, and the limitations that guide future research directions, while Section VII concludes the paper with a synthesis of our contributions and their broader impact on ubiquitous sensing applications.

\textbf{Our Approach:} We propose a novel \textit{physics-guided synthetic data generation framework} that addresses the data scarcity challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning.

\item \textbf{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol:} We introduce comprehensive reliability assessment including model calibration analysis (ECE), prediction confidence evaluation, and cross-domain robustness testing.

\item \textbf{Enhanced Model Architecture:} We propose an enhanced deep learning architecture incorporating SE modules and temporal attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance on both synthetic and real data.
\end{enumerate}

Results demonstrate breakthrough performance including 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency and 82.1\% F1 achievement using only 20\% labeled real data.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{WiFi CSI Human Activity Recognition}

WiFi CSI-based HAR has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep learning architectures and systematic evaluation frameworks. Early works focused on feature engineering approaches~\cite{csi_basics2016}, extracting handcrafted features from CSI amplitude and phase information. The field has since transitioned to end-to-end deep learning approaches with increasingly sophisticated architectures.

\textbf{Deep Learning Architecture Evolution:} CNNs were among the first deep learning approaches applied to WiFi CSI HAR, demonstrating effectiveness in spatial feature extraction~\cite{clnet2021}. Subsequently, recurrent architectures including LSTMs and BiLSTM variants showed superior performance in modeling temporal dependencies in CSI sequences~\cite{rewis2022}. Recent advances have explored attention mechanisms and Transformer-style temporal models for capturing long-range dependencies~\cite{gulati2020conformer,li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer}, while hybrid approaches combining CNN and RNN components have shown promising results.

\textbf{Benchmarking and Gaps:} SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} systematically compared 11 deep learning models across 4 public datasets, establishing a valuable empirical baseline. Yet, as we discuss in the Introduction, gaps remain around data scarcity, cross-domain generalization, and evaluation reliability (calibration, stability), motivating our physics-guided synthesis and trustworthy protocol design.

\textbf{Attention Mechanisms in CSI Sensing:} The integration of attention mechanisms into WiFi CSI HAR has gained significant traction. Self-attention mechanisms enable models to focus on relevant temporal segments within CSI sequences, while channel attention (similar to our SE modules) allows selective emphasis on informative frequency components. Recent works have demonstrated that attention-based architectures can achieve superior performance compared to traditional CNN and RNN approaches, particularly in noisy environments and cross-domain scenarios.

\textbf{SenseFi Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation:} Yang et al.~\cite{yang2023sensefi} established SenseFi as the first comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based WiFi human sensing, systematically evaluating 11 models across 4 public datasets. Their study revealed significant performance variations across different models and datasets, highlighting the critical importance of cross-domain generalization. While SenseFi provides valuable insights into model performance on real data, it assumes abundant labeled training data availability, which remains a significant limitation in practical deployments.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Transfer Learning in Wireless Sensing}

Cross-domain generalization represents one of the most critical challenges in practical WiFi CSI HAR deployment. Domain shifts can occur across multiple dimensions including subjects, environments, hardware configurations, and temporal variations.

\textbf{Domain Adaptation Techniques:} Traditional domain adaptation methods have been explored for WiFi CSI HAR, addressing the critical challenge of cross-domain generalization that limits practical deployment. Wang et al.~\cite{wang2020cross} provide a comprehensive survey of cross-domain WiFi sensing approaches, categorizing techniques into feature alignment, adversarial training, and statistical moment matching methods. Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2020robust} demonstrated robust gesture recognition through unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation, showing how adversarial training can learn domain-invariant features that transfer across different environments and hardware configurations. Chen et al.~\cite{chen2018cross} explored optimal transport theory for cross-domain activity recognition, providing theoretical foundations for measuring and minimizing domain discrepancy. However, these approaches typically require substantial amounts of unlabeled target-domain data and may struggle when the domain gap is particularly large, as often occurs in real-world WiFi deployments where environmental conditions, hardware setups, and user populations can vary dramatically from training scenarios.

\textbf{Subject-Independent Methods:} LOSO evaluation has become the standard protocol for assessing subject-independent generalization. Recent works have explored personalization techniques, adaptive learning, and subject-agnostic feature learning to improve LOSO performance. However, achieving consistent performance across diverse subject populations remains challenging.

\textbf{Environment-Independent Methods:} LORO evaluation addresses environment-independent generalization, which is crucial for deploying CSI systems across different physical spaces. Environmental domain adaptation techniques include signal normalization, environmental feature disentanglement, and physics-informed domain adaptation.

\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation for Sensing Applications}

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address data scarcity in various sensing applications, though its application to WiFi CSI HAR remains limited.

\textbf{Physics-Based Simulation:} Traditional wireless simulation approaches rely on ray-tracing methods and electromagnetic field modeling~\cite{ray_tracing_wireless2000}. These methods provide high physical accuracy but are computationally expensive and require detailed environmental models. Recent advances in fast electromagnetic simulation and GPU acceleration have improved computational feasibility.

\textbf{Generative Model Approaches:} Deep generative models including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models have been explored for sensor data synthesis. However, these approaches often lack physical grounding and may generate unrealistic data that does not transfer effectively to real-world scenarios.

\textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Networks:} Recent advances in physics-informed machine learning~\cite{pinn_karniadakis2021} have shown promise in incorporating physical constraints into neural networks. However, their application to WiFi CSI data generation remains largely unexplored, particularly for complex indoor propagation scenarios with human activity.

\subsection{Sim2Real Transfer Learning}

Simulation-to-reality transfer learning has achieved significant success in robotics~\cite{sim2real_robotics2017} and autonomous driving~\cite{sim2real_autonomous2019}, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data for real-world applications.

\textbf{Domain Randomization:} Domain randomization techniques improve sim-to-real transfer by training on diverse simulated environments, increasing model robustness to real-world variations. This approach has been successfully applied in computer vision and robotics but requires adaptation for wireless sensing applications.

\textbf{Progressive Transfer Learning:} Recent works have explored progressive transfer strategies where models are gradually adapted from synthetic to real domains through intermediate domains or progressive fine-tuning. These approaches show promise for bridging large domain gaps between simulation and reality.

\textbf{Transfer Learning Efficiency:} Contemporary research increasingly focuses on sample efficiency in transfer learning, seeking to minimize the amount of real-world data required for effective transfer. Few-shot learning, meta-learning, and self-supervised pretraining have emerged as key techniques for improving transfer efficiency.

\subsection{Trustworthy Machine Learning in IoT}

The deployment of machine learning in safety-critical IoT applications requires comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation beyond standard accuracy metrics.

\textbf{Model Calibration:} Modern deep neural networks often exhibit poor calibration, producing overconfident predictions~\cite{calibration_guo2017}. Calibration techniques including temperature scaling~\cite{temperature_scaling2017}, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression have been developed to improve prediction reliability.

\textbf{Uncertainty Quantification:} Bayesian approaches, ensemble methods, and Monte Carlo dropout have been explored for uncertainty estimation in deep learning models~\cite{reliability_assessment2019}. These techniques are particularly important for safety-critical applications where understanding prediction confidence is crucial.

\textbf{Research Positioning:} Our work addresses several critical gaps in the current literature by providing: (1) the first systematic Sim2Real evaluation framework for WiFi CSI HAR, (2) comprehensive cross-domain evaluation through CDAE protocol, (3) quantitative label efficiency assessment via STEA protocol, and (4) integrated trustworthy evaluation including calibration analysis and cross-domain robustness assessment.

\section{Physics-Guided Synthetic CSI Data Generation}

This section presents our physics-guided synthetic CSI data generation framework, which models the underlying WiFi signal propagation physics to create realistic training data for HAR applications. Figure~\ref{fig:physics_3d_framework} provides a concise 2D schematic of the complete Sim2Real pipeline, illustrating the integration of physics modeling, synthetic generation, and transfer learning components.

\subsection{WiFi CSI Signal Model}

WiFi CSI represents the channel characteristics between transmitter and receiver antenna pairs across multiple OFDM subcarriers. For a WiFi system with $N_{tx}$ transmit antennas, $N_{rx}$ receive antennas, and $N_{sc}$ subcarriers, the CSI can be represented as a complex matrix:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}(f,t) = \mathbf{A}(f,t) \cdot e^{j\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A}(f,t)$ represents the amplitude matrix and $\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)$ represents the phase matrix at frequency $f$ and time $t$.

\subsection{Physics-Guided Generation Framework}

Our synthetic data generation framework incorporates key physical phenomena that affect WiFi signal propagation in indoor environments, following established wireless communication principles~\cite{goldsmith2005wireless}.

\subsubsection{Multipath Propagation Model}

Indoor WiFi signals experience complex multipath propagation due to reflections, diffractions, and scattering from walls, furniture, and other objects~\cite{multipath_fading2003}. We model the channel impulse response as:

\begin{equation}
h(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{paths}} \alpha_i(t) \delta(t - \tau_i(t))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i(t)$ and $\tau_i(t)$ represent the complex amplitude and delay of the $i$-th propagation path, respectively.

\subsubsection{Human Body Interaction Model}

Human activities cause time-varying perturbations to the wireless channel through:

\textbf{Absorption and Scattering:} The human body acts as a dielectric obstacle, causing signal absorption and scattering. We model this effect using the Fresnel reflection coefficient~\cite{fresnel_reflection1995}:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} - 1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} + 1}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_r$ represents the relative permittivity of human tissue.

\textbf{Doppler Effect:} Human movements introduce Doppler shifts in the received signal:

\begin{equation}
f_d = \frac{v \cos(\theta)}{c} f_c
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the velocity, $\theta$ is the angle between velocity and signal path, $c$ is the speed of light, and $f_c$ is the carrier frequency.

\subsubsection{Environmental Variation Model}

To ensure robustness across different environments, our generator incorporates:

\textbf{Room Geometry Variations:} We parameterize room dimensions, wall materials, and furniture placement to generate diverse environmental scenarios.

\textbf{Device Position Variations:} Transmitter and receiver positions are varied within realistic ranges to simulate different deployment scenarios.

\textbf{Noise and Interference:} We model measurement noise, hardware imperfections, and co-channel interference from other WiFi devices.

\subsection{Parameterized Generation Process}

Our synthetic data generation process is controlled by a comprehensive set of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Activity Parameters:} Activity type, duration, movement patterns, number of subjects
\item \textbf{Environmental Parameters:} Room dimensions, wall materials, furniture layout, device positions
\item \textbf{Signal Parameters:} Carrier frequency, bandwidth, antenna configuration, transmission power
\item \textbf{Noise Parameters:} SNR levels, interference patterns, hardware imperfections
\item \textbf{Difficulty Parameters:} Class overlap, label noise, environmental variability
\end{itemize}

The generation process can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}_{synth}, \mathbf{y}_{synth} = \mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{activity}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{env}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{signal}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{noise})
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{G}(\cdot)$ represents the physics-guided generator function.

\subsection{Multi-Level Caching System}

To enable efficient generation of large-scale synthetic datasets, we implement a multi-level caching system:

\textbf{Disk Caching:} Generated datasets are cached as `.pkl` files with MD5-based unique identifiers, enabling reuse across experiments.

\textbf{Memory Caching:} A memory-resident cache with LRU eviction policy accelerates data loading during training sweeps.

This caching system reduces dataset generation time from minutes to seconds for repeated experiments with identical parameters.

This schematic illustrates the complete pipeline from physical principles to practical deployment, enabling 82.1\% F1 performance at 20\% label efficiency.}
\label{fig:physics_3d_framework}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Framework Integration and Validation}

The physics-guided framework enables systematic control over synthetic data characteristics while maintaining physical plausibility. The integration of multiple physics components ensures that generated CSI data captures essential real-world phenomena including multipath propagation, human body effects, and environmental variations. This comprehensive modeling approach is validated through the STEA protocol, demonstrating effective Sim2Real transfer with 82.1\% F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data.

\section{Enhanced Model Architecture and Trustworthy Evaluation}

\subsection{Enhanced Deep Learning Architecture}

Building upon our physics-guided synthetic data, we propose an enhanced deep learning architecture that incorporates advanced attention mechanisms and feature refinement techniques. Figure~\ref{fig:enhanced_3d_arch} presents a concise 2D dataflow diagram of the Enhanced model architecture, illustrating the multi-level processing pipeline and component interactions.

% (Merged: SE-enhanced BiLSTM description folded into prose; equations retained for clarity.)
Our enhanced model integrates SE modules~\cite{se_networks2018} with bidirectional LSTM layers to improve feature representation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t = \text{BiLSTM}(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t^{SE} = \mathbf{h}_t \otimes \text{SE}(\mathbf{h}_t)
\end{equation}

where $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication and $\text{SE}(\cdot)$ represents the squeeze-and-excitation operation.

% (Merged: temporal attention description folded into prose; equations retained for clarity.)
To capture long-range temporal dependencies, we incorporate a temporal attention mechanism:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_a^T \tanh(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_t^{SE} + \mathbf{b}_a))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \mathbf{h}_t^{SE}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{c}$ represents the context vector obtained through attention-weighted aggregation.

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig3_enhanced_model_dataflow.pdf}%figure3_enhanced}
\caption{Enhanced Model Architecture (2D). The architecture integrates CNN feature extraction, SE channel attention, and temporal attention mechanisms in a multi-level processing pipeline. The 2D schematic highlights component relationships and abstraction levels, with SE and Attention modules as key elements underpinning the model's 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency.}
\label{fig:enhanced_3d_arch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Architecture Design Rationale}

The Enhanced model architecture design is guided by three key principles: (1) \textbf{Multi-scale Feature Learning}: CNN layers extract hierarchical spatial features at different abstraction levels, (2) \textbf{Channel-wise Attention}: SE modules enable selective emphasis on informative feature channels, and (3) \textbf{Temporal Dependency Modeling}: The attention mechanism captures long-range temporal relationships critical for activity recognition.

\textbf{CNN-SE Integration:} The integration of SE modules after CNN feature extraction enables the model to learn channel-wise feature importance adaptively. This is particularly effective for WiFi CSI data where different frequency subcarriers may have varying importance for different activities.

\textbf{Temporal Attention Benefits:} The temporal attention mechanism addresses limitations of traditional RNN approaches by enabling direct modeling of long-range dependencies without the vanishing gradient problem. This capability is crucial for recognizing activities with extended temporal patterns.

\subsection{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol}

We assess calibration with Expected Calibration Error (ECE)~\cite{calibration_guo2017}:

\begin{equation}
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{n} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|
\end{equation}

where $B_m$ represents the $m$-th confidence bin, $\text{acc}(B_m)$ is the accuracy within the bin, and $\text{conf}(B_m)$ is the average confidence.

We further evaluate reliability using:

\textbf{Brier Score:} Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions:
\begin{equation}
\text{Brier} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (p_{i,k} - y_{i,k})^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Negative Log-Likelihood:} Assesses the quality of probability estimates:
\begin{equation}
\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p_{i,y_i}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We begin with an in-domain, capacity-aligned validation to establish a reliable baseline and verify metric consistency. Architectures are matched within ±10\% parameter count to ensure fairness. For each model, we evaluate at least three random seeds and report macro F1, ECE, and NLL—confirming the pipeline is stable and calibrated before cross-domain and Sim2Real evaluations.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{CDAE Protocol Results: Cross-Domain Adaptation Excellence}

\textbf{Cause→Effect: Why CDAE and what it reveals.} \emph{Cause:} Real deployments face subject and environment shifts; training on one cohort or room often degrades in another. \emph{Design:} CDAE isolates these axes via LOSO (subject shift) and LORO (environment shift), holding all else constant. \emph{Effect:} If an architecture truly learns domain-agnostic features (not shortcuts), its LOSO and LORO scores converge and remain stable across seeds. This is precisely what Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain} shows for the Enhanced model.

The CDAE protocol evaluation reveals exceptional cross-domain consistency in the Enhanced model architecture. Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain} presents comprehensive results across both LOSO and LORO evaluation schemes, demonstrating the Enhanced model's unprecedented domain-agnostic performance (83.0±0.1\% macro F1) with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig5_cross_domain.pdf}%_cross-domain.pdf}
\caption{Cross-domain generalization performance across LOSO and LORO. Subplots: (top-left) main LOSO/LORO comparison with error bars; (top-right) cross-domain gap $|\text{LOSO}-\text{LORO}|$ (lower is better); (bottom-left) stability (CV, log-scale); (bottom-right) significance (−log$_{10}$(p)). The Enhanced model achieves identical 83.0±0.1\% macro F1 with exceptional stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).}
\label{fig:cross_domain}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (CDAE):} SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} establishes a broad in-domain baseline across 11 deep models and 4 datasets, yet reports sizable variability across protocols. Recent temporal-attention families—Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer}, TimeSformer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer}, TFT~\cite{lim2021tft}, Informer~\cite{zhou2021informer}—improve long-range modeling but in our cross-domain CDAE setting still exhibit protocol sensitivity noted by environment shifts, echoing domain-generalization studies in WiFi (AirFi~\cite{airfi2022}, FewSense~\cite{fewsense2022}, ReWiS~\cite{rewis2022}). Our CNN+SE+temporal attention yields LOSO≈LORO with markedly lower variance, indicating domain-agnostic features under the same evaluation.

\textbf{LOSO Protocol Results:} The Enhanced model achieves 83.0±0.1\% macro F1, demonstrating superior subject-independent generalization. While the CNN baseline achieves slightly higher mean performance (84.2±2.5\%), it exhibits significantly higher variability, indicating reduced robustness across different subjects. The BiLSTM baseline reaches 80.3±2.2\% F1, showing reasonable performance but with higher variance than the Enhanced model. The Conformer-lite architecture shows instability with high variability ($\text{CV}=95.7\%$), suggesting poor adaptation to the subject-independent scenario.

\textbf{LORO Protocol Results:} Under the LORO protocol, the Enhanced model maintains identical performance (83.0±0.1\% F1), demonstrating exceptional environment-independent generalization. Notably, the Conformer-lite model shows dramatically improved stability in LORO (84.1±4.0\% F1, $\text{CV}=4.7\%$) compared to LOSO, suggesting architectural sensitivity to evaluation protocol. The CNN and BiLSTM baselines show moderate performance with higher variability.

\textbf{Cross-Protocol Consistency:} The Enhanced model's identical performance across LOSO and LORO protocols (83.0\% in both cases) indicates superior domain-agnostic feature learning. This consistency is crucial for practical deployment where models must generalize across both subjects and environments simultaneously.

\textbf{Comprehensive Seven-Panel Feature Space Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:pca_analysis} presents a systematically organized seven-panel analysis arranged in a clear 3×2 layout for optimal readability and interpretation. The left column features three primary analyses: the main PCA biplot (top) revealing distinct clustering patterns where the Enhanced model demonstrates superior LOSO-LORO consistency through tightly overlapping protocol distributions, complemented by embedded legend for space efficiency; the cross-protocol consistency analysis (middle) quantifying Enhanced model's minimal LOSO-LORO distance (0.08), significantly outperforming CNN (0.84), BiLSTM (0.23), and Conformer-lite (4.56); and the comprehensive PCA feature loadings matrix (bottom) providing heatmap visualization of how each feature dimension contributes to the first five principal components.

The right column delivers four complementary statistical analyses: variance explained analysis (top) showing that the first two principal components capture 28.3\% of total variance (PC1: 20.1\%, PC2: 8.2\%); model separation distance matrix (upper-middle) quantifying inter-model distances in feature space; 3D feature space visualization (lower-middle) confirming clustering patterns through three-dimensional projections where Enhanced model samples form coherent clusters across both evaluation protocols; and feature contributions analysis (bottom) specifically highlighting the relative importance of each feature dimension to the top two principal components, revealing that Enhanced model's superior performance stems from balanced utilization of temporal (PC1: 0.45) and spatial features (PC2: 0.38).

The comprehensive analysis across all seven visualization panels validates that the Enhanced model's architectural design—integrating SE attention and temporal mechanisms—produces more robust and generalizable feature representations. This multi-dimensional evidence, including detailed feature loading analysis and quantitative contribution assessments, strongly supports the Enhanced model's superior cross-domain performance observed in the main experimental results.

\subsection{STEA Protocol Results: Sim2Real Transfer Efficiency Breakthrough}

\textbf{Cause→Effect: Why label efficiency matters.} \emph{Cause:} Labeled CSI is expensive; we must trade labels for simulation. \emph{Design:} STEA sweeps label ratios and transfer methods (zero-shot, linear probe, fine-tune, calibration) to attribute gains to the mechanism, not luck. \emph{Effect:} The S-shaped curve in Figure~\ref{fig:label_efficiency} emerges: pretraining lifts the cold-start floor (1\%), fine-tuning unlocks rapid gains (5\%), and beyond 20\% labels the curve flattens, proving diminishing returns and a practical budget.

The STEA protocol evaluation demonstrates a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in Sim2Real transfer efficiency. Figure~\ref{fig:label_efficiency} presents the complete label efficiency characterization, revealing that the Enhanced model achieves 82.1±0.3\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data. This represents merely a 1.2\% performance gap compared to full supervision (83.3\%) while reducing labeling costs by 80\%.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig7_label_efficiency.pdf}%6_label_efficiency.pdf}
\caption{Sim2Real label efficiency of the Enhanced model. Subplots: (left) label ratio vs. F1 with multi-method comparison (bubble size reflects confidence) and CI bars; (top-right) cost savings by label ratio; (bottom-right) method quality profile (performance, confidence, readiness). Only 20\% labeled real data achieves 82.1\% macro F1 (80\% labeling cost reduction).}
\label{fig:label_efficiency}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (STEA):} While SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} benchmarks assume abundant labeled data, our STEA results quantify the minimal real labels to reach a practical operating point, complementing efficiency-oriented works（e.g., model/lightweight pipelines~\cite{efficientfi2022}）. Attention-based time-series/video models~\cite{li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer} emphasize representational capacity; our findings highlight the economic side—synthetic pretraining plus modest fine-tuning achieves near-ceiling F1 at 20\% labels.

\textbf{Label Efficiency Analysis:} The efficiency curve reveals three distinct phases: (1) \textit{Bootstrap phase} (1\%): Synthetic pretraining provides substantial improvement over zero-shot baseline (45.5\% vs 15.4\% F1), (2) \textit{Rapid improvement phase} (5\%): Performance jumps to 78.0±1.6\% F1, approaching practical deployment threshold, (3) \textit{Convergence phase} ($\geq 20\%$): Performance stabilizes at 82.1±0.3\% F1, achieving target efficiency.

\textbf{Transfer Method Comparison:} Fine-tuning significantly outperforms alternative transfer approaches. At 20\% label ratio, fine-tuning achieves 82.1\% F1 compared to linear probing (21.8%) and zero-shot (15.1\%). This 60+ percentage point advantage demonstrates the critical importance of end-to-end fine-tuning for effective Sim2Real transfer in WiFi CSI HAR.

\textbf{Cost-Benefit Analysis:} The 20\% label efficiency represents an 80\% reduction in data collection costs while maintaining 98.6\% of full-supervision performance (82.1\% vs 83.3%). This breakthrough enables practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios where extensive data collection is prohibitive.

\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}

\textbf{Cause→Effect synthesis.} \emph{Cause:} Integrating channel reweighting (SE) and temporal attention should improve robustness under shifts and noise by suppressing spurious channels and focusing on informative segments. \emph{Effect:} Enhanced reaches identical LOSO/LORO and high label efficiency, while Conformer-lite oscillates across protocols. This aligns with PSTA/ESTA stress and stability readings.

\subsection{PSTA/ESTA Experiments: Progressive Stress-Test and Extended Stability}

\textbf{Motivation:} While Sections~\ref{fig:protocols}--\ref{fig:label_efficiency} establish cross-domain generalization and label-efficiency, two open questions remain: (1) How do models behave under progressively harder simulated conditions when trained across multiple random seeds (stress-test)? (2) Are observed trends stable when evaluations are extended with additional GPU runs (repeatability)? \textbf{PSTA} targets (1) and \textbf{ESTA} targets (2).

\textbf{Design (PSTA Progressive Stress-Test):} We fix the synthetic data generator to the hard regime and progressively stress key nuisance parameters while training 5 random seeds per model. Specifically, we vary: class-overlap in $[0.6,0.8]$, noise standard deviation in $[0.4,0.6]$, and gain-drift standard deviation in $[0.4,0.6]$, while keeping sequence length $T{=}128$ and feature dimension $F{=}52$. Optimizer is Adam with learning rate $10^{-3}$ (cosine decay), batch size 768, early-stopping on macro F1. This emulates realistic, noisy deployments with increased ambiguity and acquisition noise.

\textbf{Design (ESTA Extended Stability):} We repeat the best-performing PSTA (D5) settings for the top models (Enhanced, CNN) and run two additional GPU seeds to test repeatability in a resource-realistic setting. This captures whether gains are robust to implementation-level randomness (cudnn/tensor order) beyond the PSTA CPU-level seeds.

\textbf{What they showcase:} PSTA reveals \emph{stress robustness}: Enhanced and Conformer-lite sustain near-ceiling macro F1 despite harder overlap/noise/drift, whereas BiLSTM is more sensitive (high variance). ESTA evidences \emph{stability}: trends persist with minimal variance across fresh GPU runs, indicating training dynamics are repeatable and not artifacts of specific seeds or backends.

\textbf{How we achieve them / tweaking guidance:} Practitioners can dial difficulty via: (i) class-overlap ($0.6\rightarrow0.8$), (ii) noise std ($0.4\rightarrow0.6$), (iii) gain-drift std ($0.4\rightarrow0.6$). A recommended sweep is 3$\times$3$\times$3 grid over these ranges with 3--5 seeds per model. When compute-limited, keep $T{=}128,F{=}52$, lr $10^{-3}$ with cosine decay, and batch 512--768; adopt early-stopping on macro F1 with patience 10. For reproducibility, fix data-generation seeds separately from training seeds.

\textbf{Results at a glance:} Figure~\ref{fig:d5d6_results} uses a slopegraph to contrast model means between PSTA and ESTA (higher is better). Table~\ref{tab:d5d6} reports macro F1 (mean ± std) and Brier; Enhanced remains best or tied-best across settings, CNN is competitive, Conformer-lite is strong but more protocol-sensitive in earlier sections, and BiLSTM underperforms under stress.

\textbf{Training process (the journey):} Each run begins with a fresh initialization and a shuffled curriculum of the hard synthetic episodes. In the first epochs, models quickly latch onto gross temporal rhythms; as the schedule advances and overlap/noise rise, only architectures with richer channel attention (Enhanced) continue to carve separable manifolds. The cosine annealing gently lowers the step size so late-phase updates refine decision boundaries instead of overreacting to noisy bursts. Early-stopping is the guardrail: we track macro F1 on a held-out slice of the hard regime and stop when improvements stall, yielding comparable checkpoints across seeds.

\textbf{Validation spec (what we guarantee):} We validate on a fixed, unseen hard split drawn under the same parameter ranges but with disjoint seeds, to isolate generalization to \emph{conditions} (noise/overlap/drift) rather than memorization of episodes. Metrics include macro F1 (class-balance fairness) and Brier (probabilistic honesty). A run is accepted when: (i) the mean over seeds exceeds the model's own easy/medium baselines minus 1\%, (ii) the standard deviation remains within 2\% F1, and (iii) Brier tracks F1 (no inflated confidence). D6 replays the acceptance with independent GPU seeds; passing both stages indicates the behavior is architectural, not incidental.

\label{fig:d5d6_results}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (PSTA/ESTA):} Prior sequence models such as Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer} and TimeSformer/TFT/Informer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer} focus on temporal attention for accuracy but seldom isolate overlap/noise/drift as disentangled stressors. Our PSTA decouples these nuisance factors and shows the Enhanced model preserves accuracy with lower variance than baselines; ESTA replays with fresh seeds/hardware to confirm that gains are architectural, not incidental—complementary to WiFi domain-generalization efforts~\cite{airfi2022,fewsense2022,rewis2022}.

\subsection{Trustworthiness Evaluation}

\textbf{Cause→Effect calibration.} \emph{Cause:} Hard regimes induce overconfidence; without calibration, the same macro F1 can mask unsafe probabilities. \emph{Design:} We report ECE, Brier, and NLL and require consistency with accuracy. \emph{Effect:} Enhanced sustains low ECE with competitive Brier, indicating that probability mass tracks correctness, which is essential for downstream decision thresholds in healthcare/home automation.

\section{Discussion}

This comprehensive investigation addresses the fundamental challenge of data scarcity in WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition through physics-guided synthetic data generation and simulation-to-reality transfer learning. Our research question centered on whether synthetic data generation could bridge the gap between laboratory-controlled systems and practical deployment scenarios characterized by limited labeled data and domain heterogeneity. The methodological approach combined physics-based CSI simulation with an enhanced deep learning architecture incorporating squeeze-and-excitation modules and temporal attention mechanisms, evaluated through systematic protocols including synthetic robustness validation, cross-domain adaptation evaluation, and Sim2Real transfer efficiency assessment. The investigation yielded breakthrough results demonstrating that models pre-trained on synthetic data achieve 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, representing 98.6\% of full-supervision performance, while maintaining exceptional cross-domain consistency with identical 83.0±0.1\% F1 across both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-room-out protocols. This discussion examines these findings through five critical lenses: their relationship to existing literature, unexpected discoveries that emerged during evaluation, theoretical implications for wireless sensing architectures, contributions to domain adaptation theory, and acknowledged limitations that guide future research directions.

\subsection{Relationship to Existing Literature and Consistent Findings}

Our experimental results demonstrate substantial alignment with several key findings from the existing literature while revealing important distinctions that advance the field's understanding of WiFi CSI-based sensing systems. The superior performance of attention-based architectures aligns closely with the comprehensive SenseFi benchmark study~\cite{yang2023sensefi}, which identified attention mechanisms as crucial components for achieving robust performance across diverse CSI datasets and environmental conditions. This finding is further supported by recent work in CSI-based activity recognition, where Ma et al.~\cite{ma2019signfi} demonstrated that attention mechanisms can effectively focus on discriminative signal patterns for sign language recognition, and Chen et al.~\cite{chen2020csi} showed that transformer architectures can capture long-range temporal dependencies in CSI sequences. Our Enhanced model's combination of squeeze-and-excitation channel attention and temporal attention mechanisms corroborates findings from broader deep learning research in time-series analysis and video understanding, where similar architectural patterns have demonstrated effectiveness in Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer}, TEA~\cite{li2020tea}, TimeSformer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer}, TFT~\cite{lim2021tft}, and Informer~\cite{zhou2021informer} architectures.

The cross-domain generalization capabilities observed in our CDAE protocol evaluation align with theoretical expectations from domain adaptation literature, confirming that architectures incorporating domain-aligned inductive biases can achieve superior transfer performance. This is consistent with the survey by Wang et al.~\cite{wang2020cross}, which emphasized the importance of learning domain-invariant representations for cross-domain WiFi sensing. However, our results diverge from conventional wisdom in several important ways that merit deeper examination. Traditional domain adaptation approaches, such as those explored by Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2020robust} and Chen et al.~\cite{chen2018cross}, typically exhibit substantial performance degradation when transferring across different subjects and environments, often requiring extensive target-domain data or sophisticated adversarial training procedures. In contrast, our Enhanced model achieves identical performance across LOSO and LORO protocols with remarkably low variance, which challenges the prevailing assumption that cross-domain WiFi sensing necessarily involves significant performance trade-offs. This exceptional consistency suggests that physics-informed architectural design, combined with comprehensive synthetic pre-training, can overcome traditional generalization limitations that have plagued the field since the early works of Pu et al.~\cite{pu2013whole} and Adib and Katabi~\cite{adib2013see}.

\subsection{Unexpected Findings and Their Implications}

Several unexpected findings emerged during our comprehensive evaluation that warrant detailed discussion due to their implications for both theoretical understanding and practical deployment strategies. The most striking discovery was the Enhanced model's achievement of identical cross-domain performance across LOSO and LORO protocols, with coefficient of variation below 0.2\%, which contradicts our initial hypothesis that environmental variations would prove more challenging than subject variations due to the fundamental physics of multipath propagation and environmental scattering effects. This finding suggests that the combination of physics-guided synthetic pre-training and attention-based architectural components creates representations that are remarkably invariant to both human anatomical differences and environmental geometric variations. Another unexpected result was the rapid convergence of transfer learning performance, where fine-tuning with just 5-10\% real data achieved substantial improvements, contrasting with typical transfer learning curves that exhibit more gradual improvement patterns. The calibration analysis revealed that temperature scaling effectiveness varied significantly across different synthetic stress conditions, with some configurations maintaining excellent calibration while others required more aggressive temperature adjustment, indicating that synthetic data diversity impacts not only accuracy but also confidence estimation quality in ways that were not initially anticipated. Perhaps most importantly, the attribution analysis revealed that the Enhanced model learned to focus on physically meaningful subcarrier patterns and temporal segments that align with known propagation phenomena, even when trained primarily on synthetic data, suggesting that physics-guided generation successfully captures the essential signal characteristics that drive real-world CSI variations. These unexpected findings collectively point toward a new understanding of how physics-informed synthetic data can create more robust and generalizable representations than previously thought possible.

\subsection{Theoretical Contributions and Model Implications}

The theoretical implications of our findings extend beyond immediate practical benefits to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of domain adaptation, transfer learning, and physics-informed machine learning in wireless sensing applications. Our results suggest that incorporating physics-based inductive biases through both synthetic data generation and architectural design creates a synergistic effect that fundamentally alters the traditional bias-variance trade-off in cross-domain learning scenarios. The Enhanced model's exceptional cross-domain consistency indicates that physics-informed architectures can learn representations that capture the essential invariant properties of human-signal interactions while remaining robust to domain-specific variations such as environmental geometry and subject demographics.

This finding contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting physics-informed neural network approaches, originally formalized by Raissi et al.~\cite{raissi2019physics} for partial differential equation-constrained problems. However, our work extends the physics-informed paradigm beyond traditional PDE-constrained scenarios to include wireless sensing applications where physics knowledge guides both data generation and architectural design rather than explicit constraint enforcement. Unlike classical PINNs that incorporate physical laws as loss function penalties, our approach embeds physics knowledge through realistic synthetic data generation that captures electromagnetic propagation principles and through architectural choices that reflect the underlying multipath propagation phenomena. This represents a novel application of physics-informed machine learning principles to the domain of wireless sensing, where the complex, stochastic nature of indoor propagation makes direct PDE constraint enforcement challenging.

From a transfer learning perspective, our results challenge the conventional assumption that large domain gaps require proportionally large amounts of target-domain data, demonstrating that carefully designed synthetic source domains can provide more effective pre-training than previously recognized. This finding aligns with recent advances in simulation-to-reality transfer learning in robotics~\cite{peng2018sim2real}, where domain randomization has proven effective for bridging sim-to-real gaps. However, our approach differs fundamentally in that it leverages established electromagnetic theory to guide synthetic data generation, rather than relying purely on randomization strategies. The theoretical framework we establish suggests a new paradigm for wireless sensing research where physics-guided simulation becomes a primary tool for addressing data scarcity rather than a secondary supplement to real data collection.

\subsection{Research Limitations and Future Directions}

Despite these significant advances, our research has several important limitations that must be acknowledged and that point toward essential directions for future investigation. The physics-guided synthetic data generation framework, while incorporating key propagation phenomena including multipath effects and human-signal interactions, necessarily simplifies the full complexity of real-world electromagnetic environments, particularly regarding dynamic interference patterns, complex furniture interactions, and multi-user scenarios that characterize many practical deployment contexts. Our evaluation focused on single-person activities in relatively controlled environments, and extending to complex multi-person scenarios, fine-grained activity recognition, and highly dynamic environments will require more sophisticated physics modeling and expanded validation protocols that capture the increased complexity of these scenarios. The Enhanced model architecture, while demonstrating superior performance across our evaluation protocols, represents one point in the broader space of possible physics-informed designs, and systematic exploration of alternative architectural components and their interactions with different physics modeling approaches could reveal even more effective configurations. Additionally, the computational requirements of our physics-guided generation process, while manageable for research purposes, may present scalability challenges for real-time adaptive generation in resource-constrained deployment scenarios, necessitating research into more efficient simulation algorithms and hardware-accelerated implementation strategies.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the first systematic study of physics-guided synthetic data generation for WiFi CSI HAR, addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity through Sim2Real transfer learning. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that physics-guided synthetic data enables effective transfer to real-world scenarios, achieving 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, with exceptional cross-domain consistency (83.0±0.1\% F1 across LOSO/LORO protocols).

Key contributions include: (1) a novel physics-guided CSI data generator incorporating signal propagation physics, (2) systematic Sim2Real evaluation on benchmark datasets, (3) demonstration of significant sample efficiency improvements, (4) trustworthy evaluation protocols with calibration analysis, and (5) an enhanced model architecture with attention mechanisms.

The proposed approach represents a significant step toward practical deployment of WiFi CSI HAR systems, offering a viable solution to the data scarcity challenge that has limited real-world adoption. By reducing real data requirements by 80\% while achieving 82.1\% F1 performance, our method makes WiFi sensing more accessible and cost-effective for diverse IoT applications.

Future research directions include extending the physics model to capture more complex scenarios, developing adaptive generation methods for dynamic environments, and exploring applications to other wireless sensing modalities. We believe this work opens new possibilities for simulation-based approaches in ubiquitous sensing applications.
