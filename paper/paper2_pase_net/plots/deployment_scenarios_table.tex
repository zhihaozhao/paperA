\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Power Constraints} & \textbf{Latency Requirements} & \textbf{User Concurrency} & \textbf{Accuracy Needs} & \textbf{Recommended Config} & \textbf{Design Rationale} \\
\midrule
Smart Home Hub & Wall-powered (flexible) & Real-time preferred (<10ms) & Multiple concurrent (2-8) & High (>80%) & PASE-Net GPU / CNN GPU & Multi-user support with attention-based accuracy \\
Wearable Device & Battery critical (<5W) & Near real-time acceptable & Single user & Medium (>75%) & CNN CPU / PASE-Net CPU & Battery optimization prioritized over latency \\
IoT Gateway & Hybrid (10-30W) & Real-time required & High throughput (10+) & High (>82%) & PASE-Net GPU with batch=8 & Maximum throughput with dynamic power management \\
Mobile Application & Battery aware (5-15W) & Responsive (<50ms) & Single with buffering & Good (>78%) & CNN GPU with batch=4 & Balance of performance and efficiency \\
Industrial Monitor & Wall-powered & Ultra real-time (<5ms) & Multiple sensors & Critical (>85%) & CNN GPU / PASE-Net GPU & Reliability and ultra-low latency for safety \\
