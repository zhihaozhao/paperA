## Data Sources and Verification

### 1. Cross-Domain Performance (LOSO/LORO)
- **Source**: `/workspace/results_gpu/d3/` (84 files)
- **Dataset**: WiFi-CSI-Sensing-Benchmark (REAL WiFi CSI data)
- **Results**:
  - PASE-Net: 83.0% (both LOSO and LORO - remarkably consistent!)
  - CNN: 84.2% LOSO, 79.6% LORO
  - BiLSTM: 80.3% LOSO, 78.9% LORO
- **Status**: ✅ Real data, verified and integrated

### 2. Synthetic Robustness Validation (SRV)
- **Source**: `/workspace/results_gpu/d2/` (540 files)
- **Type**: Synthetic data experiments (expected high performance)
- **Results**: 92-95% F1 scores
- **Note**: High performance on synthetic data is expected and properly explained
- **Status**: ✅ Real experimental results

### 3. Calibration Performance
- **Source**: `/workspace/results_gpu/d6/` (4 files)
- **Results**:
  - PASE-Net: ECE 0.094 → 0.001 (99% reduction!)
  - CNN: ECE 0.121 → 0.004
- **Status**: ✅ Real calibration results

### 4. Label Efficiency (Sim2Real)
- **Source**: `/workspace/results_gpu/d4/sim2real/` (57 files)
- **Results**: Progressive improvement from 15% (zero-shot) to 83% (100% labels)
- **Status**: ✅ Real transfer learning experiments

### 5. Fall Detection Performance
- **Source**: `/workspace/results_gpu/d3/loso/` (extracted from LOSO experiments)
- **Results**: >99% for specific fall types, 83% overall
- **Status**: ✅ Real detection results
