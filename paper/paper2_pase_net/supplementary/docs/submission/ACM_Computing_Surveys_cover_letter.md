# Cover Letter - ACM Computing Surveys

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are writing to submit our comprehensive survey and methodological contribution "Physics-Guided Synthetic WiFi CSI Data Generation for Trustworthy Human Activity Recognition: A Sim2Real Approach" for consideration in ACM Computing Surveys.

## Manuscript Overview

While our manuscript presents novel technical contributions, it also provides a comprehensive survey of the WiFi CSI-based HAR field, systematically analyzing the evolution from handcrafted features to deep learning approaches, benchmarking 11 state-of-the-art models, and identifying critical gaps that our physics-guided approach addresses.

## Survey Components and Contributions
