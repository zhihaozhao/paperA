## 🔄 If Revisions Needed

### Minor Revisions
1. **Title optimization**: Current title might be too long
   - Consider: "PASE-Net: Physics-Informed WiFi Sensing with Calibrated Cross-Domain Transfer"
   
2. **Abstract refinement**: Ensure under 250 words

3. **Conformer results**: Consider removing or explaining convergence issues

### Major Considerations
1. **Real dataset evaluation**: Consider adding SignFi or NTU-Fi results
2. **Comparison with recent work**: Add 2023-2024 references
3. **Ablation studies**: Add if requested by reviewers
