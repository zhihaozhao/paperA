# Cover Letter - IEEE Internet of Things Journal

Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Physics-Guided Synthetic WiFi CSI Data Generation for Trustworthy Human Activity Recognition: A Sim2Real Approach" for consideration for publication in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.

## Manuscript Summary

This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR): the scarcity of labeled real-world data that hinders practical deployment of IoT sensing systems. We present the first systematic simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning study in WiFi CSI HAR, introducing a physics-guided synthetic data generation framework that models electromagnetic propagation principles to create realistic training data.

## Key Contributions and Significance

Our work makes several breakthrough contributions highly relevant to the IoT community:

1. **Novel Physics-Guided Framework**: We develop a synthetic CSI data generator incorporating multipath effects, environmental variations, and human-signal interactions, enabling cost-effective data generation for IoT applications.

2. **Exceptional Data Efficiency**: Our approach achieves 82.1% macro F1 performance using only 20% labeled real data—an 80% reduction in annotation costs while maintaining 98.6% of fully-supervised performance, making WiFi sensing economically viable for widespread IoT deployment.

3. **Cross-Domain Robustness**: The enhanced architecture demonstrates identical 83.0±0.1% F1 performance across both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-room-out protocols, ensuring reliable operation across diverse IoT environments.

4. **Trustworthy AI for IoT**: We introduce comprehensive evaluation protocols including calibration analysis (ECE=0.0072) and reliability assessment, essential for safety-critical IoT applications in healthcare and elderly care.

## Relevance to IEEE IoT Journal

This manuscript aligns perfectly with IEEE IoT Journal's scope in several key areas:

- **IoT Architectures and Systems**: Novel deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms specifically designed for resource-constrained IoT devices
- **IoT Data Analytics**: Physics-guided synthetic data generation addressing the fundamental data scarcity challenge in IoT sensing
- **IoT Applications**: Practical solutions for smart home, healthcare monitoring, and elderly care applications
- **Trustworthy IoT**: Comprehensive reliability and calibration assessment for safety-critical deployments

## Novelty and Impact

To our knowledge, this is the first work to:
- Apply Sim2Real transfer learning to WiFi CSI-based HAR
- Achieve near-fully-supervised performance with only 20% real data
- Demonstrate identical cross-domain performance across different evaluation protocols
- Provide comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation including calibration metrics

The practical impact is substantial: our method reduces data collection costs by $40,000 per deployment while maintaining performance standards required for commercial IoT applications.

## Technical Rigor

The manuscript presents:
- Comprehensive evaluation across 540 synthetic robustness configurations
- Systematic comparison with 11 baseline models from the SenseFi benchmark
- Statistical validation including significance testing and confidence intervals
- Open-source implementation for reproducibility

## Declaration

This manuscript is original work not currently under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the submission. The research was conducted following ethical guidelines, with no human subjects involved in data collection.

We believe this work makes significant contributions to advancing practical IoT sensing applications and would be of great interest to the IEEE IoT Journal readership. We look forward to your editorial decision.

Sincerely,
