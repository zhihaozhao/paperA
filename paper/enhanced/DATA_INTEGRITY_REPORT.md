# üö® DATA INTEGRITY REPORT - CRITICAL ISSUES

## Executive Summary
**SEVERE DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES DETECTED**: Figure 2(c) contains fabricated data that does not match actual experimental results.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Missing Experimental Data

#### Conformer Model:
- **Status**: NO EXPERIMENTAL DATA EXISTS
- **Files checked**: paperA_conformer_hard_s0_*.json
- **Result**: 0 files found
- **Conclusion**: All Conformer results in Figure 2(c) are FABRICATED

#### Incomplete Experiments:
| Model | 0% Noise | 5% Noise | 10% Noise | 15% Noise | 20% Noise |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CNN | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing |
| BiLSTM | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing |
| Conformer | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing |
| PASE-Net | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚úÖ (1.00) | ‚ùå Missing | ‚ùå Missing |

### 2. Suspicious Perfect Scores

The existing data shows **perfect 100% F1 scores** for all models at 0-10% noise:
- This is highly unrealistic for noisy synthetic data
- Suggests possible overfitting or incorrect evaluation
- May indicate the experiments were run on trivial/toy data

### 3. Fabricated Data in Figure 2(c)

Current hard-coded values in `scr2_physics_modeling.py`:
```python
performance_matrix = np.array([
    [0.89, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75, 0.70],  # CNN - PARTIALLY FABRICATED
    [0.91, 0.87, 0.83, 0.78, 0.73],  # BiLSTM - PARTIALLY FABRICATED
    [0.93, 0.89, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75],  # Conformer - COMPLETELY FABRICATED
    [0.97, 0.95, 0.93, 0.90, 0.87]   # PASE-Net - PARTIALLY FABRICATED
])
```

**Reality Check**:
- These values do NOT match the actual experimental results
- Conformer has NO experimental data at all
- The decreasing pattern is artificially created

## Ethical Implications

### Academic Integrity Violations:
1. **Data Fabrication**: Creating data that doesn't exist (Conformer)
2. **Data Falsification**: Changing actual results (1.00 ‚Üí 0.89-0.97)
3. **Selective Reporting**: Only showing favorable synthetic patterns

### Potential Consequences:
- Paper rejection if detected during review
- Damage to academic reputation
- Possible retraction if published
- Loss of credibility in the research community

## Immediate Actions Required

### Option 1: Full Transparency (RECOMMENDED)
1. Remove Conformer from all figures and tables
2. Report actual experimental results (including perfect scores)
3. Acknowledge incomplete experiments
4. Only show data that actually exists

### Option 2: Complete the Experiments
1. Run missing Conformer experiments
2. Run missing 15% and 20% noise experiments
3. Investigate why results are perfect (possible bug?)
4. Update all figures with real data

### Option 3: Clarify as Illustrative
1. Clearly label Figure 2(c) as "Illustrative Example"
2. State that values are simulated for demonstration
3. Move actual results to a separate figure
4. Be transparent about what is real vs. illustrative

## Code to Fix Figure 2(c)

### Honest Version (Using Only Real Data):
```python
# Only show what we actually have
performance_matrix = np.array([
    [1.00, 1.00, 1.00],  # CNN (0%, 5%, 10% noise)
    [1.00, 1.00, 1.00],  # BiLSTM
    # Conformer removed - no data
    [1.00, 1.00, 1.00],  # PASE-Net
])
noise_levels = ['0%', '5%', '10%']
models = ['CNN', 'BiLSTM', 'PASE-Net']
```

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL:
1. **DO NOT SUBMIT** the paper with fabricated data
2. **IMMEDIATELY** discuss with all co-authors
3. **DECIDE** whether to complete experiments or acknowledge limitations
4. **REVISE** all figures to show only real data

### For Supervisor/PI:
- This report should be shared with the PI immediately
- Decisions about data presentation must be made at the highest level
- Consider the long-term impact on the research group's reputation

## Verification Commands

To verify these findings:
```bash
# Check for Conformer experiments
ls /workspace/results_gpu/d2/*conformer*.json
# Result: No files found

# Check actual F1 scores
for f in /workspace/results_gpu/d2/*enhanced*lab0p0.json; do
  echo $f
  cat $f | jq .metrics.macro_f1
done
# Result: All show 1.0 (perfect score)
```

## Conclusion

The current Figure 2(c) contains **fabricated data** that does not represent actual experimental results. This is a serious breach of research integrity that must be addressed before any submission.

**Immediate action is required to maintain academic integrity.**
