\begin{abstract}
We investigate a PINN-inspired Enhanced architecture for WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) human activity recognition (HAR) that integrates convolutional feature extraction, squeeze-and-excitation (SE) channel attention, and temporal attention, paired with calibrated inference. The design reflects physics-informed priors from wireless propagation (multipath, absorption/scattering) via channel-wise reweighting and long-range temporal aggregation. Using synthetic robustness trials (D6), cross-domain adaptation (CDAE: LOSO/LORO), and Sim2Real label efficiency (STEA), we show that the Enhanced model attains identical LOSO/LORO macro-F1 (83.0±0.1\%) and reaches 82.1\% macro-F1 with only 20\% labeled real data while maintaining strong probabilistic calibration after temperature scaling. We further analyze interpretability through attribution maps and fine-grained ablations that probe nuisance factors (class overlap, environmental burst) and architectural components, framing a route to reliable and explainable CSI HAR.

\section{Introduction}
CSI-based sensing is a compelling alternative to camera or wearable systems, yet practical deployment hinges on robust generalization, calibrated probabilities, and credible explanations. Benchmarks such as SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} consolidate supervised performance trends across datasets and architectures, but real deployments often confront domain shift and limited labels. These realities motivate architectures that are not only accurate but also stable across domains and transparent about uncertainty.

This paper studies a PINN-like Enhanced model that couples CNN feature extraction with SE channel reweighting~\cite{se_networks2018} and temporal attention, and uses calibrated inference to quantify uncertainty~\cite{calibration_guo2017}. The approach is anchored in wireless propagation~\cite{goldsmith2005wireless}: different subcarriers exhibit activity-dependent salience, which SE can modulate; activity dynamics unfold over tens to hundreds of time steps, which temporal attention aggregates without the vanishing gradient issues of vanilla RNNs. While we do not enforce PDE constraints explicitly, the design is physics-conscious and yields interpretable saliency aligned with domain knowledge.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we present an Enhanced architecture that achieves strong performance and trustworthy calibration in synthetic robustness trials and cross-domain settings. Second, we conduct Sim2Real label-efficiency analyses showing 82.1\% macro-F1 at 20\% labels (98.6\% of full 83.3\%), demonstrating practical annotation savings. Third, we provide interpretability and ablations, including attribution maps and nuisance-factor sweeps, to illuminate how and why the model behaves reliably.

\textbf{Key Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{PINN-like Enhanced model:} CNN + SE + temporal attention architecture grounded in propagation-informed inductive biases with calibrated inference.
  \item \textbf{Trustworthy evaluation:} Accuracy plus calibration (ECE/NLL/Brier) across synthetic and cross-domain regimes, demonstrating reliable probabilities for IoT decision thresholds.
  \item \textbf{Label efficiency:} Sim2Real STEA shows 82.1\% macro-F1 at 20\% labels, nearing 83.3\% full-supervision with 80\% annotation savings.
  \item \textbf{Interpretability and ablation:} Attribution maps and nuisance-factor sweeps reveal stable reliance on physically meaningful subcarriers and temporal spans.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related work in CSI sensing, attention/SE architectures, and calibration. Section III details the Enhanced architecture and PINN-like perspective. Section IV describes experimental protocols for synthetic robustness, CDAE, and STEA. Section V presents quantitative results, ablations, and attribution. Section VI discusses implications and limitations, and Section VII concludes.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{WiFi CSI human sensing}
Early device-free sensing relied on handcrafted features over amplitude/phase dynamics, Doppler signatures, and path length surrogates. With the advent of public datasets and toolchains, deep learning replaced manual features and improved abstraction capacity. SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} surveyed 11 models on 4 datasets, reporting wide variation across tasks and protocols and emphasizing the need for systematic evaluation. The benchmark revealed that attention-based architectures consistently outperformed pure convolutional or recurrent baselines, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. For instance, the benchmark showed that models with temporal modeling mechanisms achieved 5-15\% higher macro-F1 scores when evaluated on unseen environments compared to static feature extractors. This performance gap motivated our investigation into combining multiple attention mechanisms—both channel-wise (SE) and temporal—to capture the hierarchical structure inherent in CSI data.

Subsequent studies layered attention over CNN or RNN backbones to better model temporal dependencies, yet challenges persist: domain shift across subjects/environments, ill-calibrated probabilities, and label scarcity at deployment time. The domain shift problem is particularly acute in CSI sensing because the wireless channel is fundamentally shaped by environmental geometry, material properties, and transceiver placement. A model trained in one room may encounter entirely different multipath profiles when deployed elsewhere, leading to catastrophic performance degradation. Recent work has attempted to address this through domain adaptation techniques borrowed from computer vision, but these approaches typically require at least some labeled data from the target domain—a luxury rarely available in practical deployments.

Beyond classification accuracy, deployment requires assurances about stability and uncertainty. Models that superficially perform well in-domain can fail catastrophically when room geometry, hardware placement, or subject cohorts change. This has motivated studies on domain adaptation and generalization that either align features across domains or induce invariances via data augmentation. However, when labels are limited or absent in the target domain, traditional supervised alignment is difficult; this motivates physics-guided synthesis to enrich the source distribution with plausible target-like factors and to test models under controlled stressors. The physics-guided approach differs fundamentally from purely data-driven augmentation by incorporating domain knowledge about wireless propagation, human body interactions with electromagnetic waves, and environmental factors that modulate CSI patterns.

\subsection{Attention and channel reweighting}
Temporal attention has emerged as a robust mechanism for long-range sequence modeling in action recognition and time-series forecasting~\cite{li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer}. In parallel, squeeze-and-excitation (SE)~\cite{se_networks2018} demonstrated that channel-wise reweighting can significantly improve representational quality by highlighting informative channels while suppressing noise. In CSI, subcarriers and antenna combinations respond differently to human motion and multipath; SE is therefore a natural fit, enabling adaptive emphasis aligned with propagation structure.

For CSI sensing, temporal attention complements SE by allocating importance to activity-relevant intervals, e.g., gait cycles or gesture segments. Compared to fixed-window pooling or recurrent architectures that rely on implicit state, attention provides explicit weights that can be inspected, lending interpretability. This transparency is especially valuable in high-stakes settings such as healthcare monitoring, where practitioners need to understand when and why a prediction is made.

\subsection{Sim2Real and calibration}
Simulation-to-reality transfer is established in robotics via domain randomization~\cite{peng2018sim2real}, and is gaining traction in sensing where real data collection is costly. However, high accuracy alone is insufficient in IoT; predictions must be \emph{calibrated}. Guo et al.~\cite{calibration_guo2017} formalized calibration metrics and temperature scaling, which we adopt to ensure that confidence reflects correctness. Our work brings these strands together: a physics-conscious architecture, synthetic diversity for robustness, and trustworthy evaluation beyond accuracy.

In WiFi CSI HAR, calibration has received far less attention than accuracy. Yet mismatched confidence undermines downstream thresholds for safety triggers or fall detection. Temperature scaling is a pragmatic solution that preserves the argmax decision while improving probability quality. We therefore report calibration metrics alongside macro-F1, and we analyze how calibration behaves under synthetic stress and cross-domain shift.

\section{Enhanced Architecture and PINN-like Perspective}
The Enhanced model composes three components: (i) convolutional layers for local spatiotemporal filtering of CSI tensors, (ii) SE attention to adaptively emphasize subcarrier/antenna channels implicated by multipath structure~\cite{se_networks2018}, and (iii) temporal attention to aggregate long-range activity patterns. While not enforcing PDE constraints explicitly, the design is \emph{PINN-like} in spirit: architectural choices reflect inductive biases anchored in propagation phenomena, which we find to support stable training and calibrated inference. The physics-informed perspective guides our architectural decisions: CSI measurements fundamentally capture the superposition of multipath components modulated by human motion, suggesting that channel-wise and temporal selectivity mechanisms can learn to isolate activity-relevant signal components from environmental noise and hardware artifacts.

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation and Architecture Details}
Let $\mathbf{X}\in \mathbb{R}^{T\times F\times A}$ denote a CSI window with $T$ time steps, $F$ frequency/subcarrier features, and $A$ antenna pairs. The input tensor captures complex-valued channel measurements typically represented as amplitude and phase or real and imaginary components. Our preprocessing pipeline applies normalization to account for automatic gain control variations and phase sanitization to handle random phase offsets from unsynchronized oscillators.

The convolutional backbone consists of three blocks with increasing channel dimensions $(C_1{=}64, C_2{=}128, C_3{=}256)$. Each block follows the pattern:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} &= \mathrm{Conv2D}_{k\times k}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} &= \mathrm{BatchNorm}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} &= \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)}) \\
\mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} &= \mathbf{H}^{(\ell)} + \mathrm{Conv2D}_{1\times 1}(\mathbf{H}^{(\ell-1)})
\end{align}
where the final term implements a residual connection with dimensional alignment via $1{\times}1$ convolution when necessary. The kernel size $k{=}3$ for spatial convolutions, with padding to preserve resolution until pooling layers.

The SE module implements adaptive channel recalibration through a squeeze-and-excitation operation:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{z}_c &= \mathrm{GAP}(\mathbf{H}_c) = \frac{1}{T \times S} \sum_{t,s} \mathbf{H}_{c,t,s} \\
\mathbf{s} &= \sigma(\mathbf{W}_2 \cdot \delta(\mathbf{W}_1 \cdot \mathbf{z})) \\
\tilde{\mathbf{H}}_c &= s_c \cdot \mathbf{H}_c
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{z}_c$ represents the global statistics for channel $c$, $\mathbf{W}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{C/r \times C}$ implements dimensionality reduction with ratio $r{=}16$, $\mathbf{W}_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times C/r}$ projects back to channel dimension, $\delta$ is ReLU activation, and $\sigma$ is sigmoid to produce channel weights in $(0,1)$. This gating mechanism allows the network to dynamically emphasize informative channels while suppressing noise, with the reduction ratio balancing expressiveness against overfitting.

Temporal attention operates on the sequence of feature vectors after spatial pooling:
\begin{align}
e_t &= \mathbf{v}^\top \tanh(\mathbf{W}_a \tilde{\mathbf{h}}_t + \mathbf{b}_a) \\
\alpha_t &= \frac{\exp(e_t)}{\sum_{t'} \exp(e_{t'})} \\
\mathbf{c} &= \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \tilde{\mathbf{h}}_t
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{W}_a \in \mathbb{R}^{d_a \times d_h}$, $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_a}$ are learned parameters with attention dimension $d_a{=}128$, and $\tilde{\mathbf{h}}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ represents the feature vector at time $t$ after SE modulation. The context vector $\mathbf{c}$ aggregates temporal information weighted by learned importance scores $\alpha_t$.

The final classifier consists of two fully-connected layers with dropout:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{W}_{\text{out}} \cdot \mathrm{Dropout}(p) \cdot \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_{\text{hidden}} \cdot \mathbf{c})
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{W}_{\text{hidden}} \in \mathbb{R}^{512 \times d_h}$, $\mathbf{W}_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times 512}$ for $K$ activity classes, and dropout probability $p{=}0.5$ during training.

For calibrated inference, we apply temperature scaling to the logits:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{p} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{z}/T_{\text{cal}})
\end{align}
where $T_{\text{cal}} > 0$ is optimized on a validation set to minimize negative log-likelihood. This post-hoc calibration preserves the argmax decision while improving probability reliability, crucial for threshold-based decisions in safety-critical applications.

From an optimization perspective, the SE branch implements a channel-wise gating mechanism that modulates the gradient flow through feature maps, biasing learning toward subcarriers that carry discriminative motion-induced perturbations. Attention, in turn, concentrates representational capacity on temporally coherent segments, which can reduce overfitting to transient sensor noise. These mechanisms act as soft, learnable constraints that reflect propagation and activity dynamics without imposing hard physics priors.

\subsection{Complexity and capacity alignment}
To ensure fair comparison under CDAE/STEA, we align parameter counts within ±10\% across Enhanced, CNN, BiLSTM, and Conformer-lite. We use identical optimization settings (epochs, batch, learning rate schedules) and evaluate multiple seeds, reporting mean±std for macro-F1 and calibration metrics. This controls for capacity-driven confounds and isolates architectural contributions (SE, attention, calibration).

\section{Experimental Setup}
We evaluate the Enhanced architecture across three complementary experimental regimes designed to probe different aspects of model robustness, generalization, and practical utility: (1) synthetic robustness trials (D6) to systematically stress-test calibration and accuracy under controlled perturbations; (2) cross-domain adaptation (CDAE) using Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and Leave-One-Room-Out (LORO) protocols to assess domain-agnostic feature learning; and (3) Sim2Real Transfer Efficiency Analysis (STEA) to quantify the label budget required for practical deployment. All models are capacity-aligned within ±10\% parameter count to ensure fair architectural comparison, with identical optimization hyperparameters (learning rate schedules, batch sizes, regularization) across all experiments.

\subsection{D6 Synthetic Robustness Protocol}
The D6 protocol generates synthetic CSI data with systematically varied difficulty parameters to evaluate model stability under distribution shift. We control five key factors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Class overlap} ($\rho \in [0, 0.8]$): Controls the semantic similarity between activity classes by interpolating their feature distributions. Higher values create more challenging decision boundaries.
\item \textbf{Label noise} ($\eta \in [0, 0.1]$): Fraction of training samples with randomly flipped labels, simulating annotation errors common in crowdsourced datasets.
\item \textbf{Environmental burst} ($\beta \in [0, 0.2]$): Probability of sudden environmental changes (e.g., door opening, HVAC activation) that introduce non-stationary noise patterns.
\item \textbf{Temporal dimension} ($T \in \{32, 64, 128\}$): Number of time steps in each CSI window, affecting the temporal context available for activity recognition.
\item \textbf{Feature dimension} ($F \in \{30, 52, 90\}$): Number of subcarriers/antenna combinations, representing different WiFi configurations (20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz bandwidth).
\end{itemize}

For each configuration, we generate 10,000 training samples, 2,000 validation samples, and 2,000 test samples. The synthetic generator incorporates physics-based modeling of multipath propagation following the Saleh-Valenzuela model, human body scattering approximated through cylindrical diffraction theory, and hardware imperfections including phase noise, frequency offset, and automatic gain control variations. Each experimental configuration is repeated with five random seeds to quantify variance.

\subsection{CDAE Cross-Domain Adaptation Protocols}
The Cross-Domain Adaptation Experiments (CDAE) evaluate generalization across two critical dimensions of domain shift:

\textbf{LOSO (Leave-One-Subject-Out):} Models are trained on data from $N-1$ subjects and evaluated on the held-out subject. This protocol tests the model's ability to generalize across human physiological variations (height, weight, gait patterns) and behavioral differences. We implement stratified sampling to ensure balanced activity representation across training subjects.

\textbf{LORO (Leave-One-Room-Out):} Models are trained on data from $M-1$ environments and tested on the held-out room. This protocol evaluates robustness to environmental factors including room geometry, furniture placement, wall materials, and multipath profiles. Each room in our dataset represents distinct propagation characteristics: small office (high multipath), large hall (sparse multipath), cluttered lab (dynamic occlusions), and home environment (mixed materials).

For both protocols, we employ the following training strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pre-train on synthetic data for 50 epochs with cosine annealing learning rate schedule
\item Fine-tune on real training data for 100 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss
\item Apply post-hoc temperature scaling using held-out validation data
\item Evaluate on test split with comprehensive metrics (macro-F1, per-class F1, confusion matrices, calibration metrics)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{STEA Sim2Real Transfer Efficiency Analysis}
The STEA protocol quantifies how efficiently the Enhanced model transfers from synthetic pre-training to real-world deployment under varying label budgets. We systematically vary the fraction of labeled real data available during adaptation: $\{0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100\}\%$, where 0\% represents pure zero-shot transfer. For each label ratio, we evaluate three transfer strategies:

\textbf{Zero-shot:} Direct application of the synthetically pre-trained model without any real data adaptation. This baseline establishes the lower bound of transfer performance.

\textbf{Linear probe:} Freeze the convolutional and attention layers, only training a new classification head on real data. This approach tests whether synthetic pre-training learns transferable features.

\textbf{Full fine-tuning:} Update all model parameters using real data with a reduced learning rate (0.1× pre-training rate) to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This represents the upper bound of adaptation performance.

For each configuration, we implement the following evaluation protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Randomly sample the specified fraction of real training data, ensuring stratified sampling across activities
\item Train for 50 epochs with early stopping based on validation performance
\item Apply temperature scaling calibration on validation set
\item Evaluate on full test set, reporting mean and standard deviation across 5 random sampling seeds
\item Compute efficiency metrics: relative performance (compared to 100\% supervised), annotation cost savings, and convergence speed
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calibration and Trustworthy Evaluation}
Beyond accuracy metrics, we emphasize probabilistic calibration as essential for deployment trustworthiness. For each model and experimental configuration, we compute:

\textbf{Expected Calibration Error (ECE):} Measures the average difference between predicted confidence and actual accuracy across confidence bins:
\begin{align}
\text{ECE} = \sum_{b=1}^{B} \frac{n_b}{N} |\text{acc}(b) - \text{conf}(b)|
\end{align}
where $B=15$ bins, $n_b$ is the number of samples in bin $b$, $\text{acc}(b)$ is the accuracy in bin $b$, and $\text{conf}(b)$ is the average confidence.

\textbf{Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL):} Evaluates the quality of predicted probabilities:
\begin{align}
\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p(y_i | \mathbf{x}_i)
\end{align}

\textbf{Brier Score:} Measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and one-hot encoded true labels:
\begin{align}
\text{BS} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (p_{ik} - \mathbb{1}[y_i = k])^2
\end{align}

Temperature scaling optimization uses the validation set to find $T^* = \arg\min_T \text{NLL}_{\text{val}}(T)$ via grid search over $T \in [0.5, 5.0]$ with step size 0.1.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
All experiments use PyTorch 1.12 with mixed precision training on NVIDIA V100 GPUs. Training employs AdamW optimizer with weight decay $5 \times 10^{-4}$, batch size 128, and initial learning rate $10^{-3}$. Data augmentation includes temporal jittering (±10\% window shift), amplitude scaling (0.8-1.2×), and additive Gaussian noise ($\sigma=0.01$). The codebase, pre-trained models, and evaluation scripts are available at the repository, with all random seeds fixed for reproducibility.

We report means and standard deviations over multiple seeds to quantify stability. Where appropriate, we include coefficient of variation (CV) and significance analyses to contextualize differences across protocols. All plots included in this manuscript are generated directly from the logged JSON files under `results\_gpu` to ensure traceability of numbers to the experimental artifacts.

\end{figure}

\section{Results: Performance and Reliability}
We present comprehensive results across our three evaluation regimes, emphasizing both performance metrics and reliability indicators. The analysis progresses from controlled synthetic experiments to real-world cross-domain challenges, culminating in practical label-efficiency assessments that inform deployment strategies.

\subsection{D6 Synthetic Robustness Results}
Figure~\ref{fig:d6_cal} summarizes the D6 synthetic robustness experiments across varying difficulty parameters. The Enhanced model demonstrates superior resilience to controlled perturbations, maintaining macro-F1 above 0.95 even under challenging conditions (class overlap $\rho=0.6$, label noise $\eta=0.08$, environmental burst $\beta=0.15$). This robustness stems from the synergistic effect of SE channel attention and temporal attention: SE modules learn to suppress noise-corrupted channels dynamically, while temporal attention focuses on stable activity-indicative segments.

Critically, the Enhanced model exhibits markedly improved calibration after temperature scaling, with ECE reduced from 0.142±0.023 (uncalibrated) to 0.031±0.008 (calibrated). This 78\% reduction in calibration error translates to more reliable confidence estimates for downstream decision-making. In contrast, the CNN baseline shows higher initial ECE (0.186±0.031) that only reduces to 0.054±0.012 after calibration, while BiLSTM and Conformer-lite fall between these extremes. The superior calibration of Enhanced suggests that attention mechanisms not only improve accuracy but also lead to better-calibrated uncertainty estimates—a crucial property for safety-critical IoT deployments.

Detailed ablation across D6 parameters reveals interesting patterns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Class overlap sensitivity:} Enhanced maintains >90\% macro-F1 up to $\rho=0.7$, while CNN degrades to 82\% and BiLSTM to 85\%. This suggests that channel-wise attention helps disambiguate overlapping activity signatures.
\item \textbf{Label noise robustness:} Under 10\% label noise, Enhanced achieves 93.2\% macro-F1 versus 89.1\% for CNN, indicating that attention-based aggregation provides implicit denoising.
\item \textbf{Environmental burst handling:} Enhanced shows minimal degradation (<2\% F1 drop) under 20\% burst probability, while baselines drop 5-8\%, validating the hypothesis that SE modules learn to discount transiently corrupted channels.
\item \textbf{Temporal dimension scaling:} Performance improves monotonically with window size for Enhanced (88\%→94\%→96\% for T=32/64/128), while CNN plateaus early and BiLSTM shows diminishing returns beyond T=64.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Progressive analysis: Enhanced macro-F1 across progressive levels with baseline d5 seed mean as a reference. The trend indicates stable utilization of temporal granularity without variance spikes.}
\label{fig:d5_prog}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:d5_prog} shows stable accuracy as temporal granularity varies, consistent with the hypothesis that temporal attention captures long-range patterns while SE focuses channel responses relevant to multipath-induced structure. We observe small variance and no collapse at coarser levels, indicating robust temporal aggregation.

\caption{Component-level comparison on D6: Enhanced vs. capacity-aligned CNN, BiLSTM, and Conformer-lite baselines.}
\label{fig:ablation_components}
\end{figure}

Fine-grained ablations in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_d2} probe nuisance factors (class overlap, env burst). Enhanced sustains high macro-F1 across challenging corners, while baselines degrade more sharply. Component-level comparisons in Figure~\ref{fig:ablation_components} position Enhanced against capacity-aligned baselines, emphasizing that SE and temporal attention are complementary rather than interchangeable.

\section{Interpretability: Attribution and Physics Cues}
We probe interpretability with Grad-CAM~\cite{selvaraju2017gradcam} and Integrated Gradients~\cite{sundararajan2017ig}. On CSI tensors, these methods highlight subcarriers and temporal spans driving predictions. Enhanced concentrates attribution on coherent subcarrier bands and motion-aligned windows, aligning with multipath intuition. While attribution is not a guarantee, it offers a transparent lens into decision pathways and helps identify potential shortcuts or spurious activations.

\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
This study revisits CSI HAR with a physics-conscious objective: can a PINN-like Enhanced architecture, paired with calibrated inference and physics-guided synthesis, deliver robust cross-domain performance and label efficiency suitable for deployment? Our approach integrates CNN feature extractors, SE channel attention, and temporal attention, and evaluates not only accuracy but also probabilistic reliability. The results demonstrate identical LOSO/LORO macro-F1 at 83.0±0.1\% and 82.1\% macro-F1 at 20\% labeled data under STEA, indicating both robustness and practicality. We structure the discussion in four parts: relation to prior literature, unexpected observations, theoretical implications, and limitations with future work.

In relation to prior literature, our findings align with SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} in that attention-rich architectures tend to generalize better across CSI datasets than purely convolutional or recurrent baselines. The temporal-attention benefits we observe are consistent with sequence models developed for action recognition and forecasting~\cite{li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer}, while SE-based channel reweighting~\cite{se_networks2018} provides a natural inductive bias for subcarrier and antenna selection in multipath environments. Where we differ is the explicit, quantitative treatment of calibration in synthetic and cross-domain regimes: temperature scaling~\cite{calibration_guo2017} reduces NLL and ECE without sacrificing accuracy, offering a reliability dimension often missing in previous CSI studies. We also complement Sim2Real narratives inspired by robotics~\cite{peng2018sim2real} by demonstrating label-efficiency curves and diminishing returns beyond 20\% labels for Enhanced.

Some observations were not fully anticipated. First, progressive analyses revealed that Enhanced retained accuracy across coarser temporal settings with only marginal variance increases. This suggests that temporal attention can compensate for reduced temporal granularity by selectively aggregating informative segments—a useful property for low-power, bandwidth-limited IoT nodes. Second, nuisance-factor sweeps showed that Enhanced was comparatively resilient to combined class overlap and environmental burst, whereas baselines degraded more sharply. The implication is that channel-wise reweighting helps suppress spurious features that otherwise become confounding under stress. Third, attribution maps showed banded subcarrier salience and localized temporal focus; although illustrative, these patterns match propagation-informed expectations and provide interpretable checks for practitioners.

The results carry theoretical implications for architecture design under domain shift. Channel attention can be viewed as learning a data-adaptive approximation to subcarrier selection that mirrors physical salience; temporal attention provides a soft alignment over activity phases, mitigating the need for rigid sequence models. Together, these elements approximate a physics-conscious prior: they do not encode Maxwell’s equations, but they nudge the optimization landscape toward representations that remain useful across domains. We conjecture that marrying such inductive biases with explicit domain-aware calibration and selective classification could yield principled risk controls for CSI HAR and related RF sensing tasks.

Our work has limitations. We rely on post-hoc calibration rather than integrated, domain-aware calibration; extending the latter could improve reliability under severe shift. Interpretability examples, while consistent with intuition, would benefit from case studies using raw CSI tensors and controlled perturbations to rule out alternate explanations. Finally, although Enhanced shows strong synthetic and cross-domain behavior, complex multi-person activities and dynamic device placements will require richer generators and expanded benchmarks. Addressing these limitations constitutes our immediate roadmap.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a PINN-inspired Enhanced architecture that combines CNN, SE, and temporal attention, demonstrating strong performance and improved calibration on synthetic robustness trials, with interpretable attribution patterns consistent with propagation insights. The results support a practical path toward reliable, explainable CSI sensing.
