# 🚨 FINAL DATA INTEGRITY REPORT - CRITICAL FINDINGS

## Executive Summary
**SEVERE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY VIOLATION**: Almost ALL figures in the paper use fabricated or simulated data instead of real experimental results.

## Detailed Findings by Figure

### Figure 1: System Architecture
- **Data Type**: Diagram only (no data needed)
- **Status**: ✅ OK - Architectural diagram

### Figure 2: Physics Modeling 
- **Script**: `scr2_physics_modeling.py`
- **Status**: ❌ **FABRICATED DATA**
- **Evidence**:
  ```python
  # Line 128: "Simulate SRV validation results based on paper data"
  performance_matrix = np.array([
      [0.89, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75, 0.70],  # CNN - FABRICATED
      [0.91, 0.87, 0.83, 0.78, 0.73],  # BiLSTM - FABRICATED
      [0.93, 0.89, 0.85, 0.80, 0.75],  # Conformer - FABRICATED
      [0.97, 0.95, 0.93, 0.90, 0.87]   # PASE-Net - FABRICATED
  ])
  ```
- **Reality**: Actual experiments show ~99% F1 scores, not these values

### Figure 3: Cross-Domain Results
- **Script**: `scr3_cross_domain.py`
- **Status**: ❌ **NO REAL DATA SOURCE**
- **Evidence**: Line 127: "Simulate domain shift scenarios"
- **Issue**: Claims 83.0% LOSO/LORO but no data loading from results

### Figure 4: Calibration
- **Script**: `scr4_calibration.py`
- **Status**: ❌ **SIMULATED DATA**
- **Evidence**: 
  - Line 96: "Simulate calibration data based on ECE values"
  - Line 136: "Simulate ECE vs temperature"
  - Line 176: "Simulate prediction confidence distributions"

### Figure 5: Label Efficiency
- **Script**: `scr5_label_efficiency.py`
- **Status**: ❌ **NO REAL DATA SOURCE**
- **Issue**: Claims 82.1% with 20% labels but no actual experiments

### Figure 6: Interpretability
- **Script**: `scr6_interpretability.py`
- **Status**: ❌ **COMPLETELY SIMULATED**
- **Evidence**:
  - Line 29: "Simulate realistic SE attention patterns"
  - Line 80: "Simulate temporal attention"
  - Line 135: "Simulate SE weights vs theoretical SNR"

## Critical Discrepancies

### 1. Perfect Scores Hidden
**Actual Results** (from `/workspace/results/`):
- CNN: 99.3% F1
- BiLSTM: 99.3% F1  
- Conformer: 99.3% F1
- Enhanced: 99.3% F1

**Claimed in Paper**:
- CNN: 79.4% F1
- BiLSTM: 81.2% F1
- Conformer: 82.1% F1
- PASE-Net: 83.0% F1

**This is a 16-20% discrepancy!**

### 2. Experimental Conditions Mismatch
Real experiments have:
- `class_overlap: 0.8` (very high)
- `label_noise_prob: 0.1` (noisy)

But achieve 99%+ scores, suggesting:
- Task is too easy
- Evaluation has bugs
- Overfitting on synthetic data

### 3. Missing Cross-Domain Experiments
- No actual LOSO/LORO experiments found
- Cross-domain results appear to be fabricated

## Code Evidence

Every figure script contains telltale signs:
```python
# Common patterns found:
"simulate"     # Found in 5/6 figure scripts
"hardcoded"    # Implicit in all data
"based on paper results"  # Circular reasoning
```

## Ethical Violations

### Level 1: Data Fabrication (Most Severe)
- Creating data that doesn't exist
- All attention/interpretability visualizations
- Cross-domain results

### Level 2: Data Falsification  
- Changing 99% scores to 79-83%
- Misrepresenting experimental conditions
- Hiding perfect scores

### Level 3: Misleading Presentation
- Not labeling figures as "illustrative"
- Claiming experimental validation without data
- Circular references ("based on paper results")

## Immediate Actions Required

### STOP - Do Not Submit
1. **HALT ALL SUBMISSION PLANS**
2. **INFORM ALL CO-AUTHORS IMMEDIATELY**
3. **CONSULT WITH SUPERVISOR/PI**

### Options to Resolve

#### Option A: Complete Honesty (Recommended)
1. Re-run ALL experiments properly
2. Use ONLY real data in figures
3. Report actual results (even if 99%)
4. Explain why scores are so high

#### Option B: Methodological Paper
1. Reframe as "proposed method" paper
2. Label all figures as "illustrative examples"
3. Remove claims of experimental validation
4. Focus on architectural contributions

#### Option C: Withdraw
1. If experiments cannot be completed
2. If real results don't support claims
3. Better than risking reputation

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Count real experiment files
find /workspace/results* -name "*.json" | wc -l
# Result: 379 files exist

# Check actual F1 scores
for f in /workspace/results/paperA_*.json; do
  echo "$f: $(cat $f | jq .metrics.macro_f1)"
done
# Result: All show 0.99+ scores

# Find cross-domain experiments  
find /workspace -name "*loso*" -o -name "*loro*" 2>/dev/null
# Result: No LOSO/LORO experiments found
```

## Risk Assessment

### If Submitted As-Is:
- **100% chance** of detection during review
- **High risk** of public accusation of fraud
- **Permanent damage** to all authors' reputations
- **Possible investigation** by institution
- **Career-ending** for students/postdocs

### If Fixed Properly:
- Opportunity to publish honest work
- Build reputation for integrity
- Learn from mistakes
- Contribute real knowledge

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT SUBMIT THIS PAPER** in its current form under any circumstances.

The level of data fabrication is so extensive that it constitutes serious research misconduct. Every experimental figure uses simulated/fabricated data instead of real results.

This must be addressed at the highest level with your research supervisor immediately.
