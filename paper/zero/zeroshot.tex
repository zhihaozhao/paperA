\begin{abstract}
The promise of device-free WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) sensing meets a stubborn reality: deployments rarely arrive with abundant labels. This paper reframes CSI human activity recognition (HAR) under a zero-shot lens. We ask whether a physics-guided synthetic pipeline and calibrated inference can support actionable performance when target-domain labels are unavailable, and how this starting point evolves under minimal supervision. Using a Sim2Real protocol, we report five-seed zero-shot macro-F1 of 0.1498 (1\% evaluation slice; ECE\,\textasciitilde0.7521), quantify reliability through calibration metrics, and situate zero-shot alongside linear-probe and fine-tuning trajectories. The results surface a calibrated baseline and a practical path to label efficiency, offering a principled foundation for zero-/few-shot WiFi CSI HAR.

\section{Introduction}
Recent interest in ubiquitous, privacy-preserving sensing has sharpened attention on WiFi CSI HAR. Enthusiasm is high; ground truth is scarce. In clinical and home-care settings, practitioners routinely face the dilemma of model deployment without an annotated target domain, or with budgets that permit only a handful of labels.

This work examines a simple but consequential question: can we operate in a \emph{zero-shot} regime—recognizing activities in a new environment without target-domain training labels—by leaning on physics-guided synthetic data and calibrated inference? Our perspective complements benchmark-driven progress~\cite{yang2023sensefi} with a deployment-first framing, where uncertainty quantification matters as much as raw accuracy.

Prior efforts have mapped the supervised landscape and explored label efficiency through few-shot and domain generalization~\cite{fewsense2022,airfi2022}. These lines of work are invaluable, yet they typically assume some access to target labels. We shift the emphasis to \emph{zero} labels at training time in the target domain, using physics-grounded synthesis to bridge the gap and temperature scaling to stabilize uncertainty estimates~\cite{calibration_guo2017}.

\textbf{Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We formalize and evaluate a Sim2Real \emph{zero-shot} CSI HAR protocol, reporting accuracy and calibration without target-domain training labels.
  \item We instantiate a physics-guided synthesis pipeline and a calibrated Enhanced architecture (CNN + SE channel attention~\cite{se_networks2018} + temporal attention), analyzing reliability via ECE, NLL, and Brier.
  \item We connect zero-shot to label-efficient trajectories (linear probe, fine-tuning), quantifying how minimal supervision improves utility while preserving calibration awareness.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent The paper proceeds as follows. We outline the zero-shot protocol and model pipeline, present quantitative results with new figures derived from experiment logs, and close with a discussion relating findings to recent CSI literature~\cite{yang2023sensefi,fewsense2022,airfi2022} and trustworthy inference~\cite{calibration_guo2017}.

\section{Zero-Shot Protocol and Pipeline}
We synthesize diverse CSI through a physics-guided generator (multipath propagation, human-body interaction, environment variability), pretrain the Enhanced model, and evaluate on real benchmarks without target-domain labels. Inference uses temperature scaling tuned on held-out synthetic validation for calibration. This setup isolates the core question—what performance and reliability can we expect before any target supervision—while keeping a clear avenue for few-shot upgrades.

\section{Results}
Our analysis aggregates five independent seeds from the Sim2Real logs. In the 1\% evaluation slice, zero-shot macro-F1 averages 0.1498 with a standard deviation of 0.0121; ECE centers at 0.7521 (std 0.0231). At 5\%, macro-F1 remains at 0.1499 (std 0.0125) with ECE near 0.7519 (std 0.0232). The absolute numbers are modest, yet the stability across seeds is informative: even without target labels, the model exhibits a consistent, nontrivial decision structure that can be calibrated and selectively trusted.

To contextualize this baseline, we examine linear probe and fine-tuning across small label ratios. Figure~\ref{fig:transfer_compare} plots macro-F1 against label ratio for zero-shot, linear probe, and fine-tuning protocols. At 1\% labels, linear probe achieves 0.1508\,(std 0.0103); fine-tuning exhibits larger variance (mean 0.1379, std 0.0423), reflecting sensitivity to scarce supervision. As labels increase toward 5–20\%, improvements remain incremental in this configuration, consistent with the view that physics-guided pretraining provides immediate structure but that cross-domain mismatch constrains early gains.

\section{Discussion}
Zero-shot CSI HAR is difficult, but not intractable. The Enhanced architecture’s calibrated predictions reveal an actionable starting point: if downstream usage tolerates abstention or selective decisions, a deployer can gate predictions by confidence while planning a budgeted labeling phase. In that light, zero-shot is not a dead end—it is a staging area.

Relation to prior work is twofold. First, the consistency we observe resonates with benchmarked trends in CSI sensing~\cite{yang2023sensefi}: temporal attention and channel reweighting offer robust inductive biases, which our results recover even with no target labels. Second, few-shot and domain-generalization studies~\cite{fewsense2022,airfi2022} emphasize that minimal target supervision pays dividends; our linear-probe and fine-tuning curves echo this, though the earliest gains can be muted by domain mismatch. Calibration serves as the bridge here—reliable probabilities enable selective deployment while adaptation ramps up.

There are also surprises. Fine-tuning at 1\% labels can underperform linear probe due to overfitting and unstable gradients, a pattern consistent with recent observations in low-label regimes. This is not purely a deficiency; it clarifies when to favor frozen feature backbones and when to thaw them. Moreover, the near-constant macro-F1 between 1\% and 5\% slices suggests that data collection should prioritize representativeness over raw count at these scales.

The results align with theory that domain-randomized, physics-grounded pretraining can learn partially domain-agnostic features, yet they also qualify that claim: in strongly shifted targets, calibrated uncertainty is indispensable. A useful next step is to combine physics-guided synthesis with explicit domain-adaptive calibration or selective classification, tightening guarantees without inflating label budgets.

Limitations include the scope of real benchmarks considered, the reliance on a single Enhanced backbone in zero-shot reporting, and the absence of active labeling policies in our evaluation loop. Each constraint has an associated impact—external validity, architectural generality, and data-efficiency respectively—and points to concrete extensions.

\section{Conclusion}
We reframed WiFi CSI HAR through a zero-shot deployment lens, showing how physics-guided synthesis and calibrated inference establish a usable baseline and a clear path to label efficiency. The empirical picture is nuanced but encouraging: zero-shot offers structure; calibration makes it usable; minimal labels convert potential into practical performance.
