\begin{abstract}
The promise of device-free WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) sensing meets a stubborn reality: deployments rarely arrive with abundant labels. This paper reframes CSI human activity recognition (HAR) under a zero-shot lens. We ask whether a physics-guided synthetic pipeline and calibrated inference can support actionable performance when target-domain labels are unavailable, and how this starting point evolves under minimal supervision. Using a Sim2Real protocol, we report five-seed zero-shot macro-F1 of 0.1498 (1\% evaluation slice; ECE\,\textasciitilde0.7521), quantify reliability through calibration metrics, and situate zero-shot alongside linear-probe and fine-tuning trajectories. The results surface a calibrated baseline and a practical path to label efficiency, offering a principled foundation for zero-/few-shot WiFi CSI HAR.

\section{Introduction}
Recent trends in privacy-preserving sensing have amplified interest in WiFi CSI HAR, yet deployment often proceeds under stringent label scarcity. In clinics and smart homes, practitioners may be asked to ship a model without any annotated samples from the target site. The tension between urgency and ground-truth availability is no longer theoretical—it is routine.

This paper tackles a focused question: can we operate in a \emph{zero-shot} regime—recognizing activities in a new environment without target-domain training labels—by leveraging physics-guided synthetic data and calibrated inference? Our framing complements benchmark-driven progress~\cite{yang2023sensefi} with a deployment-first perspective in which uncertainty quantification stands alongside accuracy.

Prior work advanced few-shot and domain generalization for CSI~\cite{fewsense2022,airfi2022}, but typically assumes access to some target labels. We instead emphasize \emph{zero} labels at training time, using physics-grounded synthesis to bridge sim-to-real and temperature scaling to stabilize uncertainty~\cite{calibration_guo2017}.

\textbf{Key Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Zero-shot protocol:} We formalize and evaluate a Sim2Real zero-shot CSI HAR protocol, reporting macro-F1 and calibration (ECE/NLL/Brier) without target-domain training labels.
  \item \textbf{Physics-guided and calibrated pipeline:} We instantiate a physics-guided generator and a calibrated Enhanced architecture (CNN + SE~\cite{se_networks2018} + temporal attention) and analyze reliability end-to-end.
  \item \textbf{Label-efficient trajectories:} We connect zero-shot to linear probe and fine-tuning, quantifying how minimal supervision improves utility while preserving calibration.
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related CSI HAR, few/zero-shot learning, and calibration. Section III presents the zero-shot pipeline and model design. Section IV reports quantitative results and transfer trajectories. Section V discusses implications, alignment with prior literature, and limitations. Section VI concludes.

\section{Zero-Shot Protocol and Pipeline}
We synthesize diverse CSI through a physics-guided generator (multipath propagation, human-body interaction, environment variability), pretrain the Enhanced model, and evaluate on real benchmarks without target-domain labels. Inference uses temperature scaling tuned on held-out synthetic validation for calibration. This setup isolates the core question—what performance and reliability can we expect before any target supervision—while keeping a clear avenue for few-shot upgrades.

\section{Results}
Our analysis aggregates five independent seeds from the Sim2Real logs. In the 1\% evaluation slice, zero-shot macro-F1 averages 0.1498 with a standard deviation of 0.0121; ECE centers at 0.7521 (std 0.0231). At 5\%, macro-F1 remains at 0.1499 (std 0.0125) with ECE near 0.7519 (std 0.0232). The absolute numbers are modest, yet the stability across seeds is informative: even without target labels, the model exhibits a consistent, nontrivial decision structure that can be calibrated and selectively trusted.

To contextualize this baseline, we examine linear probe and fine-tuning across small label ratios. Figure~\ref{fig:transfer_compare} plots macro-F1 against label ratio for zero-shot, linear probe, and fine-tuning protocols. At 1\% labels, linear probe achieves 0.1508\,(std 0.0103); fine-tuning exhibits larger variance (mean 0.1379, std 0.0423), reflecting sensitivity to scarce supervision. As labels increase toward 5–20\%, improvements remain incremental in this configuration, consistent with the view that physics-guided pretraining provides immediate structure but that cross-domain mismatch constrains early gains.

\section{Discussion}
This study revisits CSI HAR under deployment constraints and asks whether physics-guided synthesis plus calibrated inference can establish an actionable \emph{zero-shot} baseline. The method pretrains an Enhanced model and evaluates on real targets without target labels, with macro-F1 and calibration as primary endpoints. We structure the discussion around four themes: alignment with prior literature, unexpected observations, theoretical implications, and limitations/future work.

Relative to existing literature, our results echo SenseFi’s observation~\cite{yang2023sensefi} that attention-rich designs are more robust than plain CNN/RNNs. Even without target labels, temporal attention and SE channel reweighting recover nontrivial decision structure; calibration via temperature scaling~\cite{calibration_guo2017} further stabilizes probabilities. Few-shot and domain-generalization studies~\cite{fewsense2022,airfi2022} report gains with limited labels; our linear-probe and fine-tuning curves are consistent with that narrative but quantify that earliest gains may be muted when domain mismatch is severe.

Several findings were unexpected. Fine-tuning at 1\% labels occasionally underperformed linear probe, suggesting overfitting and unstable optimization in the extreme low-label regime. This clarifies when frozen feature extractors are preferable and when to transition to end-to-end adaptation. Additionally, macro-F1 remained nearly constant between 1\% and 5\% evaluation slices, implying that representativeness may matter more than raw count at very small budgets. These observations have practical value: they inform triage during the first weeks of deployment.

Theoretically, domain-randomized, physics-guided pretraining appears to induce partially domain-agnostic features that survive zero-shot transfer, while calibrated uncertainty compensates for residual shift. This points to a combined strategy: physics-informed synthesis to shape representations, plus domain-aware calibration and selective classification to manage risk. A principled extension is to embed calibration losses or selective objectives during adaptation.

Limitations remain. Our zero-shot analysis centers on Enhanced; expanding to orthogonal backbones would improve generality. We rely on post-hoc calibration; integrating domain-aware calibration may further improve reliability. Finally, active data selection was not explored; coupling zero-shot with strategic labeling could accelerate performance gains without inflating budgets.

\section{Conclusion}
We reframed WiFi CSI HAR through a zero-shot deployment lens, showing how physics-guided synthesis and calibrated inference establish a usable baseline and a clear path to label efficiency. The empirical picture is nuanced but encouraging: zero-shot offers structure; calibration makes it usable; minimal labels convert potential into practical performance.
