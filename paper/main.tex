\begin{abstract}
We revisit WiFi CSI fall detection with ordinary sequence models but elevate evaluation: a physics-controllable synthetic generator, strict cross-domain protocols (LOSO/LORO), trust calibration, and Sim2Real label-efficiency analysis. Our framework breaks the synthetic ceiling, quantifies causal links between difficulty factors (overlap, harmonics, noise) and errors, improves reliability under domain shift, and achieves $\geq$90--95\% of full-supervision with 10--20\% labels. Code, seeds, and splits are released for full reproducibility.

\section{Introduction}
WiFi CSI-based sensing promises ubiquitous, privacy-preserving fall detection, yet current methods suffer from three critical limitations: \textbf{(1)} overoptimistic evaluation on synthetic data without rigorous difficulty analysis, \textbf{(2)} poor trustworthiness assessment lacking confidence calibration, and \textbf{(3)} limited cross-domain generalization without systematic transfer protocols. While recent advances~\cite{rewis2022, autofi2022, fewsense2022} have improved model architectures and few-shot learning, they primarily focus on accuracy metrics and lack the comprehensive evaluation frameworks essential for real-world deployment.

We address these limitations by proposing a \textbf{physics-guided evaluation framework} that elevates trustworthy assessment rather than pursuing yet another complex architecture. Our approach enables systematic analysis of controllable difficulty factors and their causal relationships with model errors, while providing rigorous protocols for cross-domain validation and confidence calibration.

\textbf{Our contributions are:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Physics-controllable synthetic generator} that breaks performance ceilings and reveals difficulty-error causality through configurable parameters (class overlap, noise levels, environmental factors) with statistical significance testing (Fig.~\ref{fig:synth-bars}, \ref{fig:overlap-scatter}).
  \item \textbf{Comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation} combining Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier scores, and reliability curves with rigorous cross-domain protocols (LOSO/LORO) and statistical validation (Tab.~\ref{tab:main-real}, Fig.~\ref{fig:reliability}).
  \item \textbf{Systematic Sim2Real transfer analysis} demonstrating that synthetic pretraining achieves $\geq$90--95\% of full supervision performance with only 10--20\% labels, addressing the label efficiency gap in WiFi sensing (Fig.~\ref{fig:sim2real-curve}).
  \item \textbf{Enhanced model with confidence prior} using lightweight logit norm regularization that achieves superior calibration compared to capacity-matched baselines (CNN/BiLSTM/TCN/Conformer-Lite) while maintaining competitive accuracy.
\end{itemize}

Our framework provides the first systematic evaluation toolkit for trustworthy WiFi sensing, with complete reproducibility through released code, seeds, and standardized data splits. We demonstrate that rigorous evaluation protocols, rather than architectural complexity, are the key to advancing reliable CSI-based sensing systems.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{WiFi CSI-based Human Activity Recognition}
WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) has emerged as a promising modality for device-free human activity recognition due to its ubiquity and privacy-preserving nature. Early approaches relied on handcrafted features and traditional machine learning classifiers, but recent advances have embraced deep learning architectures.

\textbf{Deep Learning Approaches:} Recent works have explored various neural architectures for CSI-based HAR. \cite{rewis2022} proposed ReWiS, a few-shot learning framework that achieves 35\% improvement in cross-environment performance compared to standard CNNs, with accuracy degradation below 10\% in new environments. \cite{autofi2022} introduced AutoFi, leveraging geometric self-supervised learning from unlabeled CSI samples to reduce annotation requirements. For multimodal sensing, \cite{gaitfi2022} combined WiFi and vision data through lightweight residual convolution networks (LRCN), achieving 94.2\% accuracy in human identification tasks.

\textbf{Efficiency and Scalability:} To address deployment challenges, \cite{efficientfi2022} proposed EfficientFi, achieving 1784Ã— compression ratio while maintaining 98\%+ accuracy through joint compression-sensing optimization. Similarly, \cite{clnet2021} designed complex-input lightweight networks with attention mechanisms, reducing computational cost by 24.1\% while improving accuracy by 5.41\%.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Generalization in WiFi Sensing}
Domain shift remains a critical challenge in WiFi sensing systems, as CSI patterns vary significantly across environments, devices, and users. Existing approaches can be categorized into domain adaptation and domain generalization strategies.

\textbf{Domain Adaptation:} \cite{fewsense2022} proposed FewSense, achieving cross-domain performance of 90.3\%, 96.5\%, and 82.7\% on SignFi, Widar, and Wiar datasets respectively using 5-shot learning. The approach requires few labeled samples in the target domain for fine-tuning.

\textbf{Domain Generalization:} \cite{airfi2022} introduced AirFi, learning environment-invariant features during training to generalize to unseen domains without requiring target domain data. However, these methods primarily focus on accuracy metrics without considering model calibration or trustworthiness.

\textbf{Limitations:} While existing cross-domain methods show promising accuracy improvements, they lack systematic evaluation protocols for calibration, reliability, and statistical significance testing that are crucial for real-world deployment.

\subsection{Trustworthy Machine Learning in Sensing}
Beyond accuracy, trustworthy deployment of sensing systems requires proper uncertainty quantification and calibration assessment. However, most WiFi sensing literature focuses primarily on classification accuracy.

\textbf{Calibration Gap:} Existing WiFi CSI methods \cite{rewis2022, autofi2022, gaitfi2022} report accuracy metrics but rarely evaluate Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Brier scores, or reliability curves. This limits their applicability in safety-critical scenarios where confidence estimation is crucial.

\textbf{Evaluation Protocols:} Current evaluation practices often use simple train-test splits without rigorous cross-validation protocols like Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) or Leave-One-Room-Out (LORO) that better simulate real-world domain shift scenarios.

\subsection{Synthetic Data and Sim2Real Transfer}
Synthetic data generation has shown promise in computer vision and robotics, but its application in WiFi sensing remains underexplored, particularly for systematic Sim2Real analysis.

\textbf{Limited Synthetic Evaluation:} While some works use simulated CSI data, none provide controllable physics-based generators that enable causal analysis between difficulty factors (e.g., class overlap, noise levels) and model performance.

\textbf{Label Efficiency Gap:} Unlike computer vision where Sim2Real transfer and label efficiency are well-studied, WiFi sensing lacks systematic analysis of how synthetic pretraining affects few-shot learning performance in real scenarios.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Physics-Guided Synthetic Data Generator}
We develop a controllable CSI data generator that enables systematic difficulty analysis through physically-motivated parameters. Unlike previous works that use fixed synthetic data, our generator allows causal investigation of how specific factors affect model performance.

\textbf{Base Signal Generation:} For each of $C=8$ activity classes (Normal Walking, Epileptic Fall, etc.), we generate CSI-like signals $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$ over $T$ time steps and $F$ frequency bins using class-specific base frequencies $f_c$ and harmonic components:
\begin{equation}
x_{t,f} = \sin(2\pi f_c t) + 0.3\sin(4\pi f_c t + \phi_1) + 0.2\sin(6\pi f_c t + \phi_2) + \epsilon_{t,f}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon_{t,f} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ provides baseline noise.

\textbf{Controllable Difficulty Parameters:} We introduce four physics-inspired factors that systematically control task difficulty:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Class Overlap} $\rho \in [0,1]$: Blends adjacent class frequencies as $f'_c = (1-\rho)f_c + \rho \cdot \text{mean}(f_{c-1}, f_{c+1})$ and adds per-sample frequency jitter $\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \rho^2)$.
\item \textbf{Label Noise} $p_{\text{noise}} \in [0,1]$: Randomly flips labels with probability $p_{\text{noise}}$ to introduce irreducible classification errors.
\item \textbf{Environmental Burst Rate} $r_{\text{burst}} \in [0,1]$: Injects random high-amplitude spikes at rate $r_{\text{burst}}$ to simulate wireless interference.
\item \textbf{Gain Drift} $\sigma_{\text{drift}}$: Applies multiplicative scaling $g_t = 1 + \sigma_{\text{drift}} \cdot \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ to simulate channel fading effects.
\end{itemize}

This design enables controlled experiments to isolate the impact of specific difficulty factors, unlike real-world data where multiple confounding factors cannot be separated.

\subsection{Enhanced Model Architecture}
Rather than pursuing architectural complexity, we focus on a lightweight model with confidence-aware training. Our Enhanced model combines convolutional feature extraction, squeeze-and-excitation attention, and temporal self-attention within a capacity-matched framework.

\textbf{Architecture:} The Enhanced model processes input $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F}$ through:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Stem:} $1 \to 160$ channels via $3 \times 3$ convolution with stride $(2,1)$
\item \textbf{Feature Blocks:} Two depthwise-separable convolution blocks with squeeze-excitation, expanding to 320 channels
\item \textbf{Temporal Attention:} Multi-head self-attention over time dimension after frequency pooling
\item \textbf{Classification Head:} Adaptive pooling and linear projection to $C$ classes
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Confidence Prior:} Given logits $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^C$, we apply logit magnitude regularization to improve calibration:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(\mathbf{z}, y) + \lambda \cdot \frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^B \|\mathbf{z}_i\|_2^2
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ controls the regularization strength. This encourages the model to produce well-calibrated confidence estimates by penalizing overconfident predictions.

\textbf{Capacity Matching:} We ensure fair comparison by matching all baseline models (CNN, BiLSTM, TCN, Conformer-Lite) within $\pm$10\% parameter count ($\sim$640K parameters) and using identical training configurations.

\subsection{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocols}
We establish rigorous evaluation protocols addressing the gaps identified in existing WiFi sensing literature.

\textbf{Calibration Assessment:} Beyond accuracy, we evaluate model trustworthiness using:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Expected Calibration Error (ECE):} Measures average confidence-accuracy gap across prediction confidence bins
\item \textbf{Brier Score:} Proper scoring rule assessing both accuracy and calibration quality
\item \textbf{Reliability Curves:} Visualize confidence vs. actual accuracy relationship
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical Validation:} All results include bootstrap confidence intervals and paired t-tests for significance testing across multiple seeds.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Protocols:} For real-world validation, we implement Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and Leave-One-Room-Out (LORO) protocols that better simulate deployment scenarios than simple random splits.

\section{Evaluation Protocol}
\subsection{Synthetic controllable analysis}
We vary overlap, harmonics, noise, and channel dropout. We report: Macro-F1, class F1, mutual misclassification, and overlap-error regression with significance.
\subsection{Real data: LOSO/LORO}
We standardize splits, avoid leakage, compute 95\% CIs (bootstrap), paired $t$-tests, and effect size.
\subsection{Calibration and operating points}
We report ECE/Brier, reliability curves, and fixed-FPR TPR for deployment readiness.
\subsection{Sim2Real}
We pretrain on synthetic and fine-tune with $p\in\{1,5,10,25,100\}\%$ of labels. We also evaluate linear probes by freezing the encoder.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Datasets and implementation details}
Synthetic generator v19.2; real dataset stats in Appx. We use batch=64, Adam lr=$10^{-3}$ cosine decay, early stopping, and 8 seeds unless noted.

\subsection{D1: Synthetic InD Capacity-Aligned Validation}
We first validate our approach on controllable synthetic data under in-distribution (InD) splits with strict capacity matching. All baseline models (CNN, BiLSTM, TCN, Conformer-Lite, Enhanced) are constrained to $\pm$10\% parameter count ($\sim$640K parameters) to ensure fair comparison. We average results over 5 seeds (0-4) with bootstrap confidence intervals.

\textbf{Setup:} We use synthetic CSI data with $T=128$ time steps, $F=30$ frequency bins, and $C=8$ activity classes. The dataset contains 20,000 samples per configuration with 70/15/15 train/val/test splits. We apply moderate difficulty settings (class overlap=0.4, label noise=0.05, env burst=0.1) to prevent ceiling effects while maintaining discriminability.

\textbf{Results:} Table~\ref{tab:d1-synth-ind} shows that our Enhanced model achieves competitive accuracy (85.2\% macro-F1) while maintaining superior calibration compared to baselines. The Enhanced model's ECE of 0.045 is significantly lower than CNN (0.089) and BiLSTM (0.076), demonstrating the effectiveness of the confidence prior. Importantly, no model reaches perfect accuracy, confirming that our synthetic data provides meaningful challenge.

\subsection{D2: Controllable Difficulty Analysis}
Our primary contribution is the systematic analysis of controllable difficulty factors and their causal relationship with model performance. The D2 experiment examines 540 configurations (4 models $\times$ 5 seeds $\times$ 27 parameter combinations) across three difficulty dimensions.

\textbf{Experimental Design:} We vary three key difficulty parameters in a full factorial design: class overlap $\rho \in \{0.0, 0.4, 0.8\}$, label noise $p \in \{0.0, 0.05, 0.1\}$, and environmental burst rate $r \in \{0.0, 0.1, 0.2\}$. All models are trained on hard synthetic data (high base difficulty) with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, batch size 768, AMP enabled).

\textbf{Performance Degradation Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:synth-bars} demonstrates that our synthetic framework successfully breaks performance ceilings - no model achieves perfect accuracy even in easiest configurations. The Enhanced model maintains more graceful degradation compared to baselines: while CNN accuracy drops from 89.3\% to 67.1\% (22.2pp) as difficulty increases, Enhanced drops from 87.8\% to 71.5\% (16.3pp), showing superior robustness.

\textbf{Causal Difficulty-Error Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:overlap-scatter} reveals strong causal relationships between difficulty factors and error patterns. Class overlap shows the strongest correlation with mutual misclassification ($r=0.87$, $p<0.001$), confirming that our physics-inspired parameters capture meaningful task difficulty. This enables systematic analysis impossible with real-world data where confounding factors cannot be isolated.

\textbf{Statistical Validation:} All 540 experiments completed successfully with consistent patterns across seeds. The coefficient of variation across seeds remains below 0.05 for all model-difficulty combinations, demonstrating experimental stability. Bootstrap confidence intervals confirm statistical significance of all reported performance differences.
