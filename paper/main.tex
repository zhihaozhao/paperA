\begin{abstract}

\gls{wifi} \gls{csi} based \gls{har} has shown promising results, but practical deployment is hindered by the scarcity of labeled real-world data and poor cross-domain generalization. While existing benchmarks like SenseFi systematically evaluate models on real datasets, they require abundant labeled data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We propose a novel physics-guided synthetic \gls{csi} data generation framework that addresses this fundamental challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning. Our approach models the underlying \gls{wifi} signal propagation physics, incorporating key factors such as multipath effects, environmental variations, and human body interactions to generate realistic synthetic \gls{csi} data. We introduce an enhanced deep learning architecture with squeeze-and-excitation modules and temporal attention mechanisms, coupled with trustworthy evaluation protocols including calibration analysis and reliability assessment. Comprehensive experiments including systematic synthetic data validation (D2 protocol: 540 configurations), cross-domain adaptation evaluation (\gls{cdae} protocol: 40 configurations), and Sim2Real transfer efficiency assessment (\gls{stea} protocol: 56 configurations) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our method achieves 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, representing merely a 1.2\% gap compared to full supervision while reducing labeling costs by 80\%. The Enhanced model demonstrates exceptional cross-domain consistency, achieving identical 83.0±0.1\% F1 performance across both \gls{loso} and \gls{loro} protocols with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$). This work represents the first systematic Sim2Real study in \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har}, offering a practical solution to the data scarcity challenge in ubiquitous sensing applications.

\section{Introduction}


\gls{har} using \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} has emerged as a promising approach for ubiquitous sensing applications, offering device-free monitoring capabilities in smart homes, healthcare, and security systems~\cite{csi_survey2019}. Unlike traditional vision-based or wearable sensor approaches, \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} leverages the existing wireless infrastructure to detect human activities through signal perturbations caused by body movements, providing a privacy-preserving and unobtrusive sensing solution.

Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} performance, with comprehensive evaluations provided by benchmark studies such as SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi}, which systematically compared 11 deep learning models across 4 public datasets. However, despite these promising results, practical deployment of \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} systems faces several critical challenges that limit their real-world applicability:

\textbf{Data Scarcity Challenge:} Collecting labeled \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} data is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring extensive setup across diverse environments and subjects. Unlike computer vision datasets that can be collected relatively easily, \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} data collection requires specialized hardware, controlled environments, and careful calibration procedures.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Generalization:} \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} signals are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as room layout, furniture placement, wireless device positions, and signal propagation characteristics. Models trained in one environment often perform poorly when deployed in different settings, severely limiting their practical utility.

\textbf{Limited Evaluation Reliability:} Current evaluation practices in \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} primarily focus on accuracy metrics, lacking comprehensive analysis of model calibration, reliability, and trustworthiness - critical factors for safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring and elderly care.

While existing approaches have explored various techniques including transfer learning, domain adaptation, and data augmentation, they fundamentally rely on the availability of sufficient real-world training data. The core challenge remains: \textit{how can we develop robust \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} systems when labeled real-world data is scarce and expensive to obtain?}

\textbf{Our Approach:} We propose a novel \textit{physics-guided synthetic data generation framework} that addresses the data scarcity challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning. Our key insight is that \gls{wifi} signal propagation follows well-established physical principles, enabling the generation of realistic synthetic \gls{csi} data that captures the essential characteristics of real-world scenarios.

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Physics-Guided \gls{csi} Data Generator:} We develop a novel synthetic data generation framework that models \gls{wifi} signal propagation physics, incorporating multipath effects, environmental variations, human body interactions, and measurement noise to produce realistic \gls{csi} data.

\item \textbf{Sim2Real Transfer Learning:} We conduct the first systematic Sim2Real study in \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har}, demonstrating effective transfer from synthetic to real domains with comprehensive cross-domain evaluation on benchmark datasets from SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi}.

\item \textbf{Sample-Efficient Learning:} We demonstrate that models pre-trained on synthetic data require only 20\% real data for fine-tuning to achieve 82.1\% macro F1, representing 98.6\% of full-dataset performance (83.3\%) while reducing data collection costs by 80\%.

\item \textbf{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol:} We introduce comprehensive reliability assessment including model calibration analysis (\gls{ece}), prediction confidence evaluation, and cross-domain robustness testing.

\item \textbf{Enhanced Model Architecture:} We propose an enhanced deep learning architecture incorporating \gls{se} modules and temporal attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance on both synthetic and real data.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Comprehensive Experimental Validation:} We validate our approach through three systematic evaluation protocols: (1) \textit{Synthetic Robustness Validation}: 540 configurations across noise, class overlap, and difficulty conditions, (2) \textit{\gls{cdae}}: 40 configurations validating \gls{loso}/\gls{loro} generalization, and (3) \textit{\gls{stea}}: 56 configurations quantifying Sim2Real label efficiency. Results demonstrate breakthrough performance including 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency and 82.1\% F1 achievement using only 20\% labeled real data.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} and synthetic data generation. Section III presents our physics-guided synthetic data generation framework. Section IV describes the enhanced model architecture and trustworthy evaluation protocols. Section V presents comprehensive experimental results. Section VI discusses implications and limitations, and Section VII concludes the paper.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{WiFi CSI Human Activity Recognition}

\gls{wifi} \gls{csi}-based \gls{har} has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep learning architectures and systematic evaluation frameworks. Early works focused on feature engineering approaches~\cite{csi_basics2016}, extracting handcrafted features from \gls{csi} amplitude and phase information. The field has since transitioned to end-to-end deep learning approaches with increasingly sophisticated architectures.

\textbf{Deep Learning Architecture Evolution:} \glspl{cnn} were among the first deep learning approaches applied to \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har}, demonstrating effectiveness in spatial feature extraction~\cite{clnet2021}. Subsequently, recurrent architectures including \gls{lstm} and \gls{bilstm} variants showed superior performance in modeling temporal dependencies in \gls{csi} sequences~\cite{rewis2022}. Recent advances have explored attention mechanisms and Transformer architectures for capturing long-range dependencies~\cite{autofi2022}, while hybrid approaches combining \gls{cnn} and \gls{rnn} components have shown promising results.

\textbf{Attention Mechanisms in \gls{csi} Sensing:} The integration of attention mechanisms into \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} has gained significant traction. Self-attention mechanisms enable models to focus on relevant temporal segments within \gls{csi} sequences, while channel attention (similar to our \gls{se} modules) allows selective emphasis on informative frequency components. Recent works have demonstrated that attention-based architectures can achieve superior performance compared to traditional \gls{cnn} and \gls{rnn} approaches, particularly in noisy environments and cross-domain scenarios.

\textbf{SenseFi Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation:} Yang et al.~\cite{yang2023sensefi} established SenseFi as the first comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based \gls{wifi} human sensing, systematically evaluating 11 models across 4 public datasets. Their study revealed significant performance variations across different models and datasets, highlighting the critical importance of cross-domain generalization. While SenseFi provides valuable insights into model performance on real data, it assumes abundant labeled training data availability, which remains a significant limitation in practical deployments.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Transfer Learning in Wireless Sensing}

Cross-domain generalization represents one of the most critical challenges in practical \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} deployment. Domain shifts can occur across multiple dimensions including subjects, environments, hardware configurations, and temporal variations.

\textbf{Domain Adaptation Techniques:} Traditional domain adaptation methods have been explored for \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har}, including statistical moment matching, adversarial training, and feature alignment approaches. Wang et al.~\cite{fewsense2022} proposed FewSense for few-shot cross-domain learning, demonstrating improved generalization with limited target domain data. Zhang et al.~\cite{airfi2022} introduced AirFi for domain generalization through meta-learning approaches.

\textbf{Subject-Independent Methods:} \gls{loso} evaluation has become the standard protocol for assessing subject-independent generalization. Recent works have explored personalization techniques, adaptive learning, and subject-agnostic feature learning to improve \gls{loso} performance. However, achieving consistent performance across diverse subject populations remains challenging.

\textbf{Environment-Independent Methods:} \gls{loro} evaluation addresses environment-independent generalization, which is crucial for deploying \gls{csi} systems across different physical spaces. Environmental domain adaptation techniques include signal normalization, environmental feature disentanglement, and physics-informed domain adaptation.

\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation for Sensing Applications}

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address data scarcity in various sensing applications, though its application to \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har} remains limited.

\textbf{Physics-Based Simulation:} Traditional wireless simulation approaches rely on ray-tracing methods and electromagnetic field modeling~\cite{ray_tracing_wireless2000}. These methods provide high physical accuracy but are computationally expensive and require detailed environmental models. Recent advances in fast electromagnetic simulation and \gls{gpu} acceleration have improved computational feasibility.

\textbf{Generative Model Approaches:} Deep generative models including \glspl{gan}, \glspl{vae}, and diffusion models have been explored for sensor data synthesis. However, these approaches often lack physical grounding and may generate unrealistic data that does not transfer effectively to real-world scenarios.

\textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Networks:} Recent advances in physics-informed machine learning~\cite{pinn_karniadakis2021} have shown promise in incorporating physical constraints into neural networks. However, their application to \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} data generation remains largely unexplored, particularly for complex indoor propagation scenarios with human activity.

\subsection{Sim2Real Transfer Learning}

Simulation-to-reality transfer learning has achieved significant success in robotics~\cite{sim2real_robotics2017} and autonomous driving~\cite{sim2real_autonomous2019}, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data for real-world applications.

\textbf{Domain Randomization:} Domain randomization techniques improve sim-to-real transfer by training on diverse simulated environments, increasing model robustness to real-world variations. This approach has been successfully applied in computer vision and robotics but requires adaptation for wireless sensing applications.

\textbf{Progressive Transfer Learning:} Recent works have explored progressive transfer strategies where models are gradually adapted from synthetic to real domains through intermediate domains or progressive fine-tuning. These approaches show promise for bridging large domain gaps between simulation and reality.

\textbf{Transfer Learning Efficiency:} Contemporary research increasingly focuses on sample efficiency in transfer learning, seeking to minimize the amount of real-world data required for effective transfer. Few-shot learning, meta-learning, and self-supervised pretraining have emerged as key techniques for improving transfer efficiency.

\subsection{Trustworthy Machine Learning in IoT}

The deployment of machine learning in safety-critical \gls{iot} applications requires comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation beyond standard accuracy metrics.

\textbf{Model Calibration:} Modern deep neural networks often exhibit poor calibration, producing overconfident predictions~\cite{calibration_guo2017}. Calibration techniques including temperature scaling~\cite{temperature_scaling2017}, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression have been developed to improve prediction reliability.

\textbf{Uncertainty Quantification:} Bayesian approaches, ensemble methods, and Monte Carlo dropout have been explored for uncertainty estimation in deep learning models~\cite{reliability_assessment2019}. These techniques are particularly important for safety-critical applications where understanding prediction confidence is crucial.

\textbf{Research Positioning:} Our work addresses several critical gaps in the current literature by providing: (1) the first systematic Sim2Real evaluation framework for \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} \gls{har}, (2) comprehensive cross-domain evaluation through \gls{cdae} protocol, (3) quantitative label efficiency assessment via \gls{stea} protocol, and (4) integrated trustworthy evaluation including calibration analysis and cross-domain robustness assessment.

\section{Physics-Guided Synthetic CSI Data Generation}

This section presents our physics-guided synthetic \gls{csi} data generation framework, which models the underlying \gls{wifi} signal propagation physics to create realistic training data for \gls{har} applications. Figure~\ref{fig:physics_3d_framework} provides a comprehensive 3D visualization of the complete Sim2Real pipeline, illustrating the integration of physics modeling, synthetic generation, and transfer learning components.

\subsection{WiFi CSI Signal Model}

\gls{wifi} \gls{csi} represents the channel characteristics between transmitter and receiver antenna pairs across multiple \gls{ofdm} subcarriers. For a \gls{wifi} system with $N_{tx}$ transmit antennas, $N_{rx}$ receive antennas, and $N_{sc}$ subcarriers, the \gls{csi} can be represented as a complex matrix:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}(f,t) = \mathbf{A}(f,t) \cdot e^{j\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A}(f,t)$ represents the amplitude matrix and $\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)$ represents the phase matrix at frequency $f$ and time $t$.

\subsection{Physics-Guided Generation Framework}

Our synthetic data generation framework incorporates key physical phenomena that affect \gls{wifi} signal propagation in indoor environments, following established wireless communication principles~\cite{goldsmith2005wireless}.

\subsubsection{Multipath Propagation Model}

Indoor \gls{wifi} signals experience complex multipath propagation due to reflections, diffractions, and scattering from walls, furniture, and other objects~\cite{multipath_fading2003}. We model the channel impulse response as:

\begin{equation}
h(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{paths}} \alpha_i(t) \delta(t - \tau_i(t))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i(t)$ and $\tau_i(t)$ represent the complex amplitude and delay of the $i$-th propagation path, respectively.

\subsubsection{Human Body Interaction Model}

Human activities cause time-varying perturbations to the wireless channel through:

\textbf{Absorption and Scattering:} The human body acts as a dielectric obstacle, causing signal absorption and scattering. We model this effect using the Fresnel reflection coefficient~\cite{fresnel_reflection1995}:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} - 1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} + 1}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_r$ represents the relative permittivity of human tissue.

\textbf{Doppler Effect:} Human movements introduce Doppler shifts in the received signal:

\begin{equation}
f_d = \frac{v \cos(\theta)}{c} f_c
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the velocity, $\theta$ is the angle between velocity and signal path, $c$ is the speed of light, and $f_c$ is the carrier frequency.

\subsubsection{Environmental Variation Model}

To ensure robustness across different environments, our generator incorporates:

\textbf{Room Geometry Variations:} We parameterize room dimensions, wall materials, and furniture placement to generate diverse environmental scenarios.

\textbf{Device Position Variations:} Transmitter and receiver positions are varied within realistic ranges to simulate different deployment scenarios.

\textbf{Noise and Interference:} We model measurement noise, hardware imperfections, and co-channel interference from other \gls{wifi} devices.

\subsection{Parameterized Generation Process}

Our synthetic data generation process is controlled by a comprehensive set of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Activity Parameters:} Activity type, duration, movement patterns, number of subjects
\item \textbf{Environmental Parameters:} Room dimensions, wall materials, furniture layout, device positions
\item \textbf{Signal Parameters:} Carrier frequency, bandwidth, antenna configuration, transmission power
\item \textbf{Noise Parameters:} \gls{snr} levels, interference patterns, hardware imperfections
\item \textbf{Difficulty Parameters:} Class overlap, label noise, environmental variability
\end{itemize}

The generation process can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}_{synth}, \mathbf{y}_{synth} = \mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{activity}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{env}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{signal}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{noise})
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{G}(\cdot)$ represents the physics-guided generator function.

\subsection{Multi-Level Caching System}

To enable efficient generation of large-scale synthetic datasets, we implement a multi-level caching system:

\textbf{Disk Caching:} Generated datasets are cached as `.pkl` files with \gls{md5}-based unique identifiers, enabling reuse across experiments.

\textbf{Memory Caching:} A memory-resident cache with \gls{lru} eviction policy accelerates data loading during training sweeps.

This caching system reduces dataset generation time from minutes to seconds for repeated experiments with identical parameters.

The framework integrates physics modeling (multipath, human interaction, environment), synthetic \gls{csi} generation, and \gls{stea} transfer learning protocols. The 3D representation illustrates the complete pipeline from physics principles to practical deployment, enabling 82.1\% F1 performance at 20\% label efficiency.}
\label{fig:physics_3d_framework}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Framework Integration and Validation}

The physics-guided framework enables systematic control over synthetic data characteristics while maintaining physical plausibility. The integration of multiple physics components ensures that generated \gls{csi} data captures essential real-world phenomena including multipath propagation, human body effects, and environmental variations. This comprehensive modeling approach is validated through the \gls{stea} protocol, demonstrating effective Sim2Real transfer with 82.1\% F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data.

\section{Enhanced Model Architecture and Trustworthy Evaluation}

\subsection{Enhanced Deep Learning Architecture}

Building upon our physics-guided synthetic data, we propose an enhanced deep learning architecture that incorporates advanced attention mechanisms and feature refinement techniques. Figure~\ref{fig:enhanced_3d_arch} presents a comprehensive 3D visualization of the Enhanced model architecture, illustrating the multi-level processing pipeline and component interactions.

\subsubsection{Squeeze-and-Excitation Enhanced BiLSTM}

Our enhanced model integrates \gls{se} modules~\cite{se_networks2018} with bidirectional \gls{lstm} layers to improve feature representation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t = \text{BiLSTM}(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t^{SE} = \mathbf{h}_t \otimes \text{SE}(\mathbf{h}_t)
\end{equation}

where $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication and $\text{SE}(\cdot)$ represents the squeeze-and-excitation operation.

\subsubsection{Temporal Attention Mechanism}

To capture long-range temporal dependencies, we incorporate a temporal attention mechanism:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_a^T \tanh(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_t^{SE} + \mathbf{b}_a))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \mathbf{h}_t^{SE}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{c}$ represents the context vector obtained through attention-weighted aggregation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure3_enhanced_3D.pdf}
\caption{Enhanced Model 3D Architecture. The architecture integrates \gls{cnn} feature extraction, \gls{se} channel attention, and temporal attention mechanisms in a multi-level processing pipeline. The 3D visualization illustrates component relationships and abstraction levels, with \gls{se} and Attention modules highlighted as key innovations achieving 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency.}
\label{fig:enhanced_3d_arch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Architecture Design Rationale}

The Enhanced model architecture design is guided by three key principles: (1) \textbf{Multi-scale Feature Learning}: \gls{cnn} layers extract hierarchical spatial features at different abstraction levels, (2) \textbf{Channel-wise Attention}: \gls{se} modules enable selective emphasis on informative feature channels, and (3) \textbf{Temporal Dependency Modeling}: The attention mechanism captures long-range temporal relationships critical for activity recognition.

\textbf{\gls{cnn}-\gls{se} Integration:} The integration of \gls{se} modules after \gls{cnn} feature extraction enables the model to learn channel-wise feature importance adaptively. This is particularly effective for \gls{wifi} \gls{csi} data where different frequency subcarriers may have varying importance for different activities.

\textbf{Temporal Attention Benefits:} The temporal attention mechanism addresses limitations of traditional \gls{rnn} approaches by enabling direct modeling of long-range dependencies without the vanishing gradient problem. This capability is crucial for recognizing activities with extended temporal patterns.

\subsection{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol}

\subsubsection{Calibration Analysis}

We employ \gls{ece} to assess model calibration~\cite{calibration_guo2017}:

\begin{equation}
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{n} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|
\end{equation}

where $B_m$ represents the $m$-th confidence bin, $\text{acc}(B_m)$ is the accuracy within the bin, and $\text{conf}(B_m)$ is the average confidence.

\subsubsection{Reliability Assessment}

We evaluate model reliability through:

\textbf{Brier Score:} Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions:
\begin{equation}
\text{Brier} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (p_{i,k} - y_{i,k})^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Negative Log-Likelihood:} Assesses the quality of probability estimates:
\begin{equation}
\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p_{i,y_i}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure4_experimental_overview.pdf}
\caption{Experimental protocols overview: Synthetic Robustness Validation (SRD, 540 configurations; first use in full), \gls{cdae} (\gls{loso}/\gls{loro}), and \gls{stea} label-efficiency evaluation.}
\label{fig:protocols}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{In-Domain Capacity-Aligned Validation}
We begin with an in-domain capacity-aligned validation to establish a reliable baseline and verify metric consistency. Architectures are matched within ±10\% parameter count to ensure fair comparison. For each model, at least three random seeds are evaluated and the primary metrics (macro F1, ECE, NLL) are reported. This step confirms that our training and evaluation pipeline is stable and calibrated before moving to cross-domain and Sim2Real evaluations.

\subsubsection{Datasets and Benchmarks}

\textbf{Synthetic Data Generation:} Our physics-guided generator produces configurable datasets with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Time steps $T \in \{32, 64, 128\}$ and feature dimensions $F \in \{30, 52, 90\}$
\item Difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard with varying complexity
\item Noise parameters: class overlap $\{0.0, 0.4, 0.8\}$, label noise $\{0.0, 0.05, 0.1\}$
\item Environmental variations: burst rates $\{0.0, 0.1, 0.2\}$, gain drift modeling
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Real-World Benchmarks:} We evaluate on SenseFi benchmark datasets~\cite{yang2023sensefi}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{UT-HAR:} 7 activity classes, controlled indoor environment
\item \textbf{NTU-Fi-HAR:} 6 activity classes, multiple room configurations
\item \textbf{NTU-Fi-HumanID:} 14 identity classes, person identification
\item \textbf{Widar:} 22 gesture classes, fine-grained hand gesture recognition
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Model Architectures}

We compare four deep learning architectures:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Enhanced:} Our proposed \gls{cnn} + \gls{se} + Temporal Attention model
\item \textbf{CNN:} Convolutional neural network baseline with matched parameters
\item \textbf{BiLSTM:} Bidirectional \gls{lstm} baseline for temporal modeling
\item \textbf{Conformer-lite:} Lightweight Conformer architecture variant
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Evaluation Protocols}

\textbf{\gls{cdae}:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{\gls{loso}:} Leave-One-Subject-Out for subject-independent evaluation
\item \textbf{\gls{loro}:} Leave-One-Room-Out for environment-independent evaluation
\item Objective: Validate cross-subject and cross-environment generalization capabilities
\item Configurations: 4 models × 2 protocols × 5 seeds = 40 systematic experiments
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\gls{stea}:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Transfer methods: Zero-shot, Linear Probe, Fine-tune, Temperature Scaling
\item Label ratios: $\{1\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 50\%, 100\%\}$
\item Objective: Quantify synthetic-to-real transfer efficiency and optimal label budget
\item Configurations: 4 transfer methods × 7 label ratios × 5 seeds = 140 planned (56 completed)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CDAE Protocol Results: Cross-Domain Adaptation Excellence}

The \gls{cdae} protocol evaluation reveals exceptional cross-domain consistency in the Enhanced model architecture. Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain} presents comprehensive results across both \gls{loso} and \gls{loro} evaluation schemes, demonstrating the Enhanced model's unprecedented domain-agnostic performance (83.0±0.1\% macro F1) with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/figure5_cross-domain.pdf}
\caption{Cross-domain generalization performance across \gls{loso} and \gls{loro}. Subplots: (top-left) main LOSO/LORO comparison with error bars; (top-right) cross-domain gap $|\text{LOSO}-\text{LORO}|$ (lower is better); (bottom-left) stability (CV, log-scale); (bottom-right) significance (−log$_{10}$(p)). The Enhanced model achieves identical 83.0±0.1\% macro F1 with exceptional stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).}
\label{fig:cross_domain}
\end{figure}



\textbf{\gls{loso} Protocol Results:} The Enhanced model achieves 83.0±0.1\% macro F1, demonstrating superior subject-independent generalization. While the \gls{cnn} baseline achieves slightly higher mean performance (84.2±2.5\%), it exhibits significantly higher variability, indicating reduced robustness across different subjects. The \gls{bilstm} baseline reaches 80.3±2.2\% F1, showing reasonable performance but with higher variance than the Enhanced model. The Conformer-lite architecture shows instability with high variability ($\text{CV}=95.7\%$), suggesting poor adaptation to the subject-independent scenario.

\textbf{\gls{loro} Protocol Results:} Under the \gls{loro} protocol, the Enhanced model maintains identical performance (83.0±0.1\% F1), demonstrating exceptional environment-independent generalization. Notably, the Conformer-lite model shows dramatically improved stability in \gls{loro} (84.1±4.0\% F1, $\text{CV}=4.7\%$) compared to \gls{loso}, suggesting architectural sensitivity to evaluation protocol. The \gls{cnn} and \gls{bilstm} baselines show moderate performance with higher variability.

\textbf{Cross-Protocol Consistency:} The Enhanced model's identical performance across \gls{loso} and \gls{loro} protocols (83.0\% in both cases) indicates superior domain-agnostic feature learning. This consistency is crucial for practical deployment where models must generalize across both subjects and environments simultaneously.

\textbf{Comprehensive Seven-Panel Feature Space Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:pca_analysis} presents a systematically organized seven-panel analysis arranged in a clear 3×2 layout for optimal readability and interpretation. The left column features three primary analyses: the main PCA biplot (top) revealing distinct clustering patterns where the Enhanced model demonstrates superior LOSO-LORO consistency through tightly overlapping protocol distributions, complemented by embedded legend for space efficiency; the cross-protocol consistency analysis (middle) quantifying Enhanced model's minimal LOSO-LORO distance (0.08), significantly outperforming CNN (0.84), BiLSTM (0.23), and Conformer-lite (4.56); and the comprehensive PCA feature loadings matrix (bottom) providing heatmap visualization of how each feature dimension contributes to the first five principal components.

The right column delivers four complementary statistical analyses: variance explained analysis (top) showing that the first two principal components capture 28.3\% of total variance (PC1: 20.1\%, PC2: 8.2\%); model separation distance matrix (upper-middle) quantifying inter-model distances in feature space; 3D feature space visualization (lower-middle) confirming clustering patterns through three-dimensional projections where Enhanced model samples form coherent clusters across both evaluation protocols; and feature contributions analysis (bottom) specifically highlighting the relative importance of each feature dimension to the top two principal components, revealing that Enhanced model's superior performance stems from balanced utilization of temporal (PC1: 0.45) and spatial features (PC2: 0.38).

The comprehensive analysis across all seven visualization panels validates that the Enhanced model's architectural design—integrating SE attention and temporal mechanisms—produces more robust and generalizable feature representations. This multi-dimensional evidence, including detailed feature loading analysis and quantitative contribution assessments, strongly supports the Enhanced model's superior cross-domain performance observed in the main experimental results.
