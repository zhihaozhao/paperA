\begin{abstract}

Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) Channel State Information (CSI) based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has shown promising results, but practical deployment is hindered by the scarcity of labeled real-world data and poor cross-domain generalization. While existing benchmarks like SenseFi systematically evaluate models on real datasets, they require abundant labeled data that is expensive and time-consuming to collect. We propose a novel physics-guided synthetic CSI data generation framework that addresses this fundamental challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning. Our approach models the underlying WiFi signal propagation physics, incorporating key factors such as multipath effects, environmental variations, and human body interactions to generate realistic synthetic CSI data. We introduce an enhanced deep learning architecture with squeeze-and-excitation modules and temporal attention mechanisms, coupled with trustworthy evaluation protocols including calibration analysis and reliability assessment. Comprehensive experiments including systematic synthetic data validation (D2 protocol: 540 configurations), cross-domain adaptation evaluation (CDAE protocol: 40 configurations), and Sim2Real transfer efficiency assessment (STEA protocol: 56 configurations) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our method achieves 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, representing merely a 1.2\% gap compared to full supervision while reducing labeling costs by 80\%. The Enhanced model demonstrates exceptional cross-domain consistency, achieving identical 83.0±0.1\% F1 performance across both leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) and leave-one-room-out (LORO) protocols with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$). This work represents the first systematic Sim2Real study in WiFi CSI HAR, offering a practical solution to the data scarcity challenge in ubiquitous sensing applications.

\section{Introduction}


HAR using WiFi CSI has emerged as a promising approach for ubiquitous sensing applications, offering device-free monitoring capabilities in smart homes, healthcare, and security systems~\cite{csi_survey2019}. Unlike traditional vision-based or wearable sensor approaches, WiFi CSI leverages the existing wireless infrastructure to detect human activities through signal perturbations caused by body movements, providing a privacy-preserving and unobtrusive sensing solution.

Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved WiFi CSI HAR performance, with comprehensive evaluations provided by benchmark studies such as SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi}, which systematically compared 11 deep learning models across 4 public datasets. However, despite these promising results, practical deployment of WiFi CSI HAR systems faces several critical challenges that limit their real-world applicability:

\textbf{Data Scarcity Challenge:} Collecting labeled WiFi CSI data is labor-intensive and time-consuming, requiring extensive setup across diverse environments and subjects. Unlike computer vision datasets that can be collected relatively easily, WiFi CSI data collection requires specialized hardware, controlled environments, and careful calibration procedures.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Generalization:} WiFi CSI signals are highly sensitive to environmental factors such as room layout, furniture placement, wireless device positions, and signal propagation characteristics. Models trained in one environment often perform poorly when deployed in different settings, severely limiting their practical utility.

\textbf{Limited Evaluation Reliability:} Current evaluation practices in WiFi CSI HAR primarily focus on accuracy metrics, lacking comprehensive analysis of model calibration, reliability, and trustworthiness - critical factors for safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring and elderly care.

While existing approaches have explored various techniques including transfer learning, domain adaptation, and data augmentation, they fundamentally rely on the availability of sufficient real-world training data. The core challenge remains: \textit{how can we develop robust WiFi CSI HAR systems when labeled real-world data is scarce and expensive to obtain?}

\textbf{Our Approach:} We propose a novel \textit{physics-guided synthetic data generation framework} that addresses the data scarcity challenge through simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) transfer learning. Our key insight is that WiFi signal propagation follows well-established physical principles, enabling the generation of realistic synthetic CSI data that captures the essential characteristics of real-world scenarios.

\textbf{Key Contributions:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Physics-Guided CSI Data Generator:} We develop a novel synthetic data generation framework that models WiFi signal propagation physics, incorporating multipath effects, environmental variations, human body interactions, and measurement noise to produce realistic CSI data.

\item \textbf{Sim2Real Transfer Learning:} We conduct the first systematic Sim2Real study in WiFi CSI HAR, demonstrating effective transfer from synthetic to real domains with comprehensive cross-domain evaluation on benchmark datasets from SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi}.

\item \textbf{Sample-Efficient Learning:} We demonstrate that models pre-trained on synthetic data require only 20\% real data for fine-tuning to achieve 82.1\% macro F1, representing 98.6\% of full-dataset performance (83.3%) while reducing data collection costs by 80\%.

\item \textbf{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol:} We introduce comprehensive reliability assessment including model calibration analysis (ECE), prediction confidence evaluation, and cross-domain robustness testing.

\item \textbf{Enhanced Model Architecture:} We propose an enhanced deep learning architecture incorporating SE modules and temporal attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance on both synthetic and real data.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Comprehensive Experimental Validation:} We validate our approach through three systematic evaluation protocols: (1) \textit{Synthetic Robustness Validation}: 540 configurations across noise, class overlap, and difficulty conditions, (2) \textit{CDAE}: 40 configurations validating LOSO/LORO generalization, and (3) \textit{STEA}: 56 configurations quantifying Sim2Real label efficiency. Results demonstrate breakthrough performance including 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency and 82.1\% F1 achievement using only 20\% labeled real data.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in WiFi CSI HAR and synthetic data generation. Section III presents our physics-guided synthetic data generation framework. Section IV describes the enhanced model architecture and trustworthy evaluation protocols.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{WiFi CSI Human Activity Recognition}

WiFi CSI-based HAR has evolved significantly with the advancement of deep learning architectures and systematic evaluation frameworks. Early works focused on feature engineering approaches~\cite{csi_basics2016}, extracting handcrafted features from CSI amplitude and phase information. The field has since transitioned to end-to-end deep learning approaches with increasingly sophisticated architectures.

\textbf{Deep Learning Architecture Evolution:} CNNs were among the first deep learning approaches applied to WiFi CSI HAR, demonstrating effectiveness in spatial feature extraction~\cite{clnet2021}. Subsequently, recurrent architectures including LSTMs and BiLSTM variants showed superior performance in modeling temporal dependencies in CSI sequences~\cite{rewis2022}. Recent advances have explored attention mechanisms and Transformer-style temporal models for capturing long-range dependencies~\cite{gulati2020conformer,li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer}, while hybrid approaches combining CNN and RNN components have shown promising results.

\textbf{Benchmarking and Gaps:} SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} systematically compared 11 deep learning models across 4 public datasets, establishing a valuable empirical baseline. Yet, as we discuss in the Introduction, gaps remain around data scarcity, cross-domain generalization, and evaluation reliability (calibration, stability), motivating our physics-guided synthesis and trustworthy protocol design.

\textbf{Attention Mechanisms in CSI Sensing:} The integration of attention mechanisms into WiFi CSI HAR has gained significant traction. Self-attention mechanisms enable models to focus on relevant temporal segments within CSI sequences, while channel attention (similar to our SE modules) allows selective emphasis on informative frequency components. Recent works have demonstrated that attention-based architectures can achieve superior performance compared to traditional CNN and RNN approaches, particularly in noisy environments and cross-domain scenarios.

\textbf{SenseFi Benchmark and Systematic Evaluation:} Yang et al.~\cite{yang2023sensefi} established SenseFi as the first comprehensive benchmark for deep learning-based WiFi human sensing, systematically evaluating 11 models across 4 public datasets. Their study revealed significant performance variations across different models and datasets, highlighting the critical importance of cross-domain generalization. While SenseFi provides valuable insights into model performance on real data, it assumes abundant labeled training data availability, which remains a significant limitation in practical deployments.

\subsection{Cross-Domain Transfer Learning in Wireless Sensing}

Cross-domain generalization represents one of the most critical challenges in practical WiFi CSI HAR deployment. Domain shifts can occur across multiple dimensions including subjects, environments, hardware configurations, and temporal variations.

\textbf{Domain Adaptation Techniques:} Traditional domain adaptation methods have been explored for WiFi CSI HAR, including statistical moment matching, adversarial training, and feature alignment approaches. Wang et al.~\cite{fewsense2022} proposed FewSense for few-shot cross-domain learning, demonstrating improved generalization with limited target domain data. Zhang et al.~\cite{airfi2022} introduced AirFi for domain generalization through meta-learning approaches.

\textbf{Subject-Independent Methods:} LOSO evaluation has become the standard protocol for assessing subject-independent generalization. Recent works have explored personalization techniques, adaptive learning, and subject-agnostic feature learning to improve LOSO performance. However, achieving consistent performance across diverse subject populations remains challenging.

\textbf{Environment-Independent Methods:} LORO evaluation addresses environment-independent generalization, which is crucial for deploying CSI systems across different physical spaces. Environmental domain adaptation techniques include signal normalization, environmental feature disentanglement, and physics-informed domain adaptation.

\subsection{Synthetic Data Generation for Sensing Applications}

Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address data scarcity in various sensing applications, though its application to WiFi CSI HAR remains limited.

\textbf{Physics-Based Simulation:} Traditional wireless simulation approaches rely on ray-tracing methods and electromagnetic field modeling~\cite{ray_tracing_wireless2000}. These methods provide high physical accuracy but are computationally expensive and require detailed environmental models. Recent advances in fast electromagnetic simulation and GPU acceleration have improved computational feasibility.

\textbf{Generative Model Approaches:} Deep generative models including GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models have been explored for sensor data synthesis. However, these approaches often lack physical grounding and may generate unrealistic data that does not transfer effectively to real-world scenarios.

\textbf{Physics-Informed Neural Networks:} Recent advances in physics-informed machine learning~\cite{pinn_karniadakis2021} have shown promise in incorporating physical constraints into neural networks. However, their application to WiFi CSI data generation remains largely unexplored, particularly for complex indoor propagation scenarios with human activity.

\subsection{Sim2Real Transfer Learning}

Simulation-to-reality transfer learning has achieved significant success in robotics~\cite{sim2real_robotics2017} and autonomous driving~\cite{sim2real_autonomous2019}, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data for real-world applications.

\textbf{Domain Randomization:} Domain randomization techniques improve sim-to-real transfer by training on diverse simulated environments, increasing model robustness to real-world variations. This approach has been successfully applied in computer vision and robotics but requires adaptation for wireless sensing applications.

\textbf{Progressive Transfer Learning:} Recent works have explored progressive transfer strategies where models are gradually adapted from synthetic to real domains through intermediate domains or progressive fine-tuning. These approaches show promise for bridging large domain gaps between simulation and reality.

\textbf{Transfer Learning Efficiency:} Contemporary research increasingly focuses on sample efficiency in transfer learning, seeking to minimize the amount of real-world data required for effective transfer. Few-shot learning, meta-learning, and self-supervised pretraining have emerged as key techniques for improving transfer efficiency.

\subsection{Trustworthy Machine Learning in IoT}

The deployment of machine learning in safety-critical IoT applications requires comprehensive trustworthiness evaluation beyond standard accuracy metrics.

\textbf{Model Calibration:} Modern deep neural networks often exhibit poor calibration, producing overconfident predictions~\cite{calibration_guo2017}. Calibration techniques including temperature scaling~\cite{temperature_scaling2017}, Platt scaling, and isotonic regression have been developed to improve prediction reliability.

\textbf{Uncertainty Quantification:} Bayesian approaches, ensemble methods, and Monte Carlo dropout have been explored for uncertainty estimation in deep learning models~\cite{reliability_assessment2019}. These techniques are particularly important for safety-critical applications where understanding prediction confidence is crucial.

\textbf{Research Positioning:} Our work addresses several critical gaps in the current literature by providing: (1) the first systematic Sim2Real evaluation framework for WiFi CSI HAR, (2) comprehensive cross-domain evaluation through CDAE protocol, (3) quantitative label efficiency assessment via STEA protocol, and (4) integrated trustworthy evaluation including calibration analysis and cross-domain robustness assessment.

\section{Physics-Guided Synthetic CSI Data Generation}

This section presents our physics-guided synthetic CSI data generation framework, which models the underlying WiFi signal propagation physics to create realistic training data for HAR applications. Figure~\ref{fig:physics_3d_framework} provides a concise 2D schematic of the complete Sim2Real pipeline, illustrating the integration of physics modeling, synthetic generation, and transfer learning components.

\subsection{WiFi CSI Signal Model}

WiFi CSI represents the channel characteristics between transmitter and receiver antenna pairs across multiple OFDM subcarriers. For a WiFi system with $N_{tx}$ transmit antennas, $N_{rx}$ receive antennas, and $N_{sc}$ subcarriers, the CSI can be represented as a complex matrix:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{H}(f,t) = \mathbf{A}(f,t) \cdot e^{j\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{A}(f,t)$ represents the amplitude matrix and $\boldsymbol{\Phi}(f,t)$ represents the phase matrix at frequency $f$ and time $t$.

\subsection{Physics-Guided Generation Framework}

Our synthetic data generation framework incorporates key physical phenomena that affect WiFi signal propagation in indoor environments, following established wireless communication principles~\cite{goldsmith2005wireless}.

\subsubsection{Multipath Propagation Model}

Indoor WiFi signals experience complex multipath propagation due to reflections, diffractions, and scattering from walls, furniture, and other objects~\cite{multipath_fading2003}. We model the channel impulse response as:

\begin{equation}
h(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{paths}} \alpha_i(t) \delta(t - \tau_i(t))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha_i(t)$ and $\tau_i(t)$ represent the complex amplitude and delay of the $i$-th propagation path, respectively.

\subsubsection{Human Body Interaction Model}

Human activities cause time-varying perturbations to the wireless channel through:

\textbf{Absorption and Scattering:} The human body acts as a dielectric obstacle, causing signal absorption and scattering. We model this effect using the Fresnel reflection coefficient~\cite{fresnel_reflection1995}:

\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} - 1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_r} + 1}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_r$ represents the relative permittivity of human tissue.

\textbf{Doppler Effect:} Human movements introduce Doppler shifts in the received signal:

\begin{equation}
f_d = \frac{v \cos(\theta)}{c} f_c
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the velocity, $\theta$ is the angle between velocity and signal path, $c$ is the speed of light, and $f_c$ is the carrier frequency.

\subsubsection{Environmental Variation Model}

To ensure robustness across different environments, our generator incorporates:

\textbf{Room Geometry Variations:} We parameterize room dimensions, wall materials, and furniture placement to generate diverse environmental scenarios.

\textbf{Device Position Variations:} Transmitter and receiver positions are varied within realistic ranges to simulate different deployment scenarios.

\textbf{Noise and Interference:} We model measurement noise, hardware imperfections, and co-channel interference from other WiFi devices.

\subsection{Parameterized Generation Process}

Our synthetic data generation process is controlled by a comprehensive set of parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Activity Parameters:} Activity type, duration, movement patterns, number of subjects
\item \textbf{Environmental Parameters:} Room dimensions, wall materials, furniture layout, device positions
\item \textbf{Signal Parameters:} Carrier frequency, bandwidth, antenna configuration, transmission power
\item \textbf{Noise Parameters:} SNR levels, interference patterns, hardware imperfections
\item \textbf{Difficulty Parameters:} Class overlap, label noise, environmental variability
\end{itemize}

The generation process can be formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{X}_{synth}, \mathbf{y}_{synth} = \mathcal{G}(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{activity}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{env}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{signal}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{noise})
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{G}(\cdot)$ represents the physics-guided generator function.

\subsection{Multi-Level Caching System}

To enable efficient generation of large-scale synthetic datasets, we implement a multi-level caching system:

\textbf{Disk Caching:} Generated datasets are cached as `.pkl` files with MD5-based unique identifiers, enabling reuse across experiments.

\textbf{Memory Caching:} A memory-resident cache with LRU eviction policy accelerates data loading during training sweeps.

This caching system reduces dataset generation time from minutes to seconds for repeated experiments with identical parameters.

This schematic illustrates the complete pipeline from physical principles to practical deployment, enabling 82.1\% F1 performance at 20\% label efficiency.}
\label{fig:physics_3d_framework}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Framework Integration and Validation}

The physics-guided framework enables systematic control over synthetic data characteristics while maintaining physical plausibility. The integration of multiple physics components ensures that generated CSI data captures essential real-world phenomena including multipath propagation, human body effects, and environmental variations. This comprehensive modeling approach is validated through the STEA protocol, demonstrating effective Sim2Real transfer with 82.1\% F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data.

\section{Enhanced Model Architecture and Trustworthy Evaluation}

\subsection{Enhanced Deep Learning Architecture}

Building upon our physics-guided synthetic data, we propose an enhanced deep learning architecture that incorporates advanced attention mechanisms and feature refinement techniques. Figure~\ref{fig:enhanced_3d_arch} presents a concise 2D dataflow diagram of the Enhanced model architecture, illustrating the multi-level processing pipeline and component interactions.

% (Merged: SE-enhanced BiLSTM description folded into prose; equations retained for clarity.)
Our enhanced model integrates SE modules~\cite{se_networks2018} with bidirectional LSTM layers to improve feature representation:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t = \text{BiLSTM}(\mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{h}_{t-1})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t^{SE} = \mathbf{h}_t \otimes \text{SE}(\mathbf{h}_t)
\end{equation}

where $\otimes$ denotes element-wise multiplication and $\text{SE}(\cdot)$ represents the squeeze-and-excitation operation.

% (Merged: temporal attention description folded into prose; equations retained for clarity.)
To capture long-range temporal dependencies, we incorporate a temporal attention mechanism:

\begin{equation}
\alpha_t = \text{softmax}(\mathbf{W}_a^T \tanh(\mathbf{W}_h \mathbf{h}_t^{SE} + \mathbf{b}_a))
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \alpha_t \mathbf{h}_t^{SE}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{c}$ represents the context vector obtained through attention-weighted aggregation.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig3_enhanced_model_dataflow.pdf}%figure3_enhanced}
\caption{Enhanced Model Architecture (2D). The architecture integrates CNN feature extraction, SE channel attention, and temporal attention mechanisms in a multi-level processing pipeline. The 2D schematic highlights component relationships and abstraction levels, with SE and Attention modules as key elements underpinning the model's 83.0±0.1\% F1 cross-domain consistency.}
\label{fig:enhanced_3d_arch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Architecture Design Rationale}

The Enhanced model architecture design is guided by three key principles: (1) \textbf{Multi-scale Feature Learning}: CNN layers extract hierarchical spatial features at different abstraction levels, (2) \textbf{Channel-wise Attention}: SE modules enable selective emphasis on informative feature channels, and (3) \textbf{Temporal Dependency Modeling}: The attention mechanism captures long-range temporal relationships critical for activity recognition.

\textbf{CNN-SE Integration:} The integration of SE modules after CNN feature extraction enables the model to learn channel-wise feature importance adaptively. This is particularly effective for WiFi CSI data where different frequency subcarriers may have varying importance for different activities.

\textbf{Temporal Attention Benefits:} The temporal attention mechanism addresses limitations of traditional RNN approaches by enabling direct modeling of long-range dependencies without the vanishing gradient problem. This capability is crucial for recognizing activities with extended temporal patterns.

\subsection{Trustworthy Evaluation Protocol}

We assess calibration with Expected Calibration Error (ECE)~\cite{calibration_guo2017}:

\begin{equation}
\text{ECE} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{|B_m|}{n} |\text{acc}(B_m) - \text{conf}(B_m)|
\end{equation}

where $B_m$ represents the $m$-th confidence bin, $\text{acc}(B_m)$ is the accuracy within the bin, and $\text{conf}(B_m)$ is the average confidence.

We further evaluate reliability using:

\textbf{Brier Score:} Measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions:
\begin{equation}
\text{Brier} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} (p_{i,k} - y_{i,k})^2
\end{equation}

\textbf{Negative Log-Likelihood:} Assesses the quality of probability estimates:
\begin{equation}
\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log p_{i,y_i}
\end{equation}

\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\label{fig:protocols}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We begin with an in-domain, capacity-aligned validation to establish a reliable baseline and verify metric consistency. Architectures are matched within ±10\% parameter count to ensure fairness. For each model, we evaluate at least three random seeds and report macro F1, ECE, and NLL—confirming the pipeline is stable and calibrated before cross-domain and Sim2Real evaluations.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{CDAE Protocol Results: Cross-Domain Adaptation Excellence}

\textbf{Cause→Effect: Why CDAE and what it reveals.} \emph{Cause:} Real deployments face subject and environment shifts; training on one cohort or room often degrades in another. \emph{Design:} CDAE isolates these axes via LOSO (subject shift) and LORO (environment shift), holding all else constant. \emph{Effect:} If an architecture truly learns domain-agnostic features (not shortcuts), its LOSO and LORO scores converge and remain stable across seeds. This is precisely what Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain} shows for the Enhanced model.

The CDAE protocol evaluation reveals exceptional cross-domain consistency in the Enhanced model architecture. Figure~\ref{fig:cross_domain} presents comprehensive results across both LOSO and LORO evaluation schemes, demonstrating the Enhanced model's unprecedented domain-agnostic performance (83.0±0.1\% macro F1) with remarkable stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/fig5_cross_domain.pdf}%_cross-domain.pdf}
\caption{Cross-domain generalization performance across LOSO and LORO. Subplots: (top-left) main LOSO/LORO comparison with error bars; (top-right) cross-domain gap $|\text{LOSO}-\text{LORO}|$ (lower is better); (bottom-left) stability (CV, log-scale); (bottom-right) significance (−log$_{10}$(p)). The Enhanced model achieves identical 83.0±0.1\% macro F1 with exceptional stability ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$).}
\label{fig:cross_domain}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (CDAE):} SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} establishes a broad in-domain baseline across 11 deep models and 4 datasets, yet reports sizable variability across protocols. Recent temporal-attention families—Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer}, TimeSformer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer}, TFT~\cite{lim2021tft}, Informer~\cite{zhou2021informer}—improve long-range modeling but in our cross-domain CDAE setting still exhibit protocol sensitivity noted by environment shifts, echoing domain-generalization studies in WiFi (AirFi~\cite{airfi2022}, FewSense~\cite{fewsense2022}, ReWiS~\cite{rewis2022}). Our CNN+SE+temporal attention yields LOSO≈LORO with markedly lower variance, indicating domain-agnostic features under the same evaluation.

\textbf{LOSO Protocol Results:} The Enhanced model achieves 83.0±0.1\% macro F1, demonstrating superior subject-independent generalization. While the CNN baseline achieves slightly higher mean performance (84.2±2.5\%), it exhibits significantly higher variability, indicating reduced robustness across different subjects. The BiLSTM baseline reaches 80.3±2.2\% F1, showing reasonable performance but with higher variance than the Enhanced model. The Conformer-lite architecture shows instability with high variability ($\text{CV}=95.7\%$), suggesting poor adaptation to the subject-independent scenario.

\textbf{LORO Protocol Results:} Under the LORO protocol, the Enhanced model maintains identical performance (83.0±0.1\% F1), demonstrating exceptional environment-independent generalization. Notably, the Conformer-lite model shows dramatically improved stability in LORO (84.1±4.0\% F1, $\text{CV}=4.7\%$) compared to LOSO, suggesting architectural sensitivity to evaluation protocol. The CNN and BiLSTM baselines show moderate performance with higher variability.

\textbf{Cross-Protocol Consistency:} The Enhanced model's identical performance across LOSO and LORO protocols (83.0\% in both cases) indicates superior domain-agnostic feature learning. This consistency is crucial for practical deployment where models must generalize across both subjects and environments simultaneously.

\textbf{Comprehensive Seven-Panel Feature Space Analysis:} Figure~\ref{fig:pca_analysis} presents a systematically organized seven-panel analysis arranged in a clear 3×2 layout for optimal readability and interpretation. The left column features three primary analyses: the main PCA biplot (top) revealing distinct clustering patterns where the Enhanced model demonstrates superior LOSO-LORO consistency through tightly overlapping protocol distributions, complemented by embedded legend for space efficiency; the cross-protocol consistency analysis (middle) quantifying Enhanced model's minimal LOSO-LORO distance (0.08), significantly outperforming CNN (0.84), BiLSTM (0.23), and Conformer-lite (4.56); and the comprehensive PCA feature loadings matrix (bottom) providing heatmap visualization of how each feature dimension contributes to the first five principal components.

The right column delivers four complementary statistical analyses: variance explained analysis (top) showing that the first two principal components capture 28.3\% of total variance (PC1: 20.1\%, PC2: 8.2\%); model separation distance matrix (upper-middle) quantifying inter-model distances in feature space; 3D feature space visualization (lower-middle) confirming clustering patterns through three-dimensional projections where Enhanced model samples form coherent clusters across both evaluation protocols; and feature contributions analysis (bottom) specifically highlighting the relative importance of each feature dimension to the top two principal components, revealing that Enhanced model's superior performance stems from balanced utilization of temporal (PC1: 0.45) and spatial features (PC2: 0.38).

The comprehensive analysis across all seven visualization panels validates that the Enhanced model's architectural design—integrating SE attention and temporal mechanisms—produces more robust and generalizable feature representations. This multi-dimensional evidence, including detailed feature loading analysis and quantitative contribution assessments, strongly supports the Enhanced model's superior cross-domain performance observed in the main experimental results.

\subsection{STEA Protocol Results: Sim2Real Transfer Efficiency Breakthrough}

\textbf{Cause→Effect: Why label efficiency matters.} \emph{Cause:} Labeled CSI is expensive; we must trade labels for simulation. \emph{Design:} STEA sweeps label ratios and transfer methods (zero-shot, linear probe, fine-tune, calibration) to attribute gains to the mechanism, not luck. \emph{Effect:} The S-shaped curve in Figure~\ref{fig:label_efficiency} emerges: pretraining lifts the cold-start floor (1\%), fine-tuning unlocks rapid gains (5\%), and beyond 20\% labels the curve flattens, proving diminishing returns and a practical budget.

The STEA protocol evaluation demonstrates a paradigm-shifting breakthrough in Sim2Real transfer efficiency. Figure~\ref{fig:label_efficiency} presents the complete label efficiency characterization, revealing that the Enhanced model achieves 82.1±0.3\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data. This represents merely a 1.2\% performance gap compared to full supervision (83.3\%) while reducing labeling costs by 80\%.

Subplots: (left) label ratio vs. F1 with multi-method comparison (bubble size reflects confidence) and CI bars; (top-right) cost savings by label ratio; (bottom-right) method quality profile (performance, confidence, readiness). Only 20\% labeled real data achieves 82.1\% macro F1 (80\% labeling cost reduction).}
\label{fig:label_efficiency}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (STEA):} While SenseFi~\cite{yang2023sensefi} benchmarks assume abundant labeled data, our STEA results quantify the minimal real labels to reach a practical operating point, complementing efficiency-oriented works（e.g., model/lightweight pipelines~\cite{efficientfi2022}）. Attention-based time-series/video models~\cite{li2020tea,bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer} emphasize representational capacity; our findings highlight the economic side—synthetic pretraining plus modest fine-tuning achieves near-ceiling F1 at 20\% labels.

\textbf{Label Efficiency Analysis:} The efficiency curve reveals three distinct phases: (1) \textit{Bootstrap phase} (1\%): Synthetic pretraining provides substantial improvement over zero-shot baseline (45.5\% vs 15.4\% F1), (2) \textit{Rapid improvement phase} (5\%): Performance jumps to 78.0±1.6\% F1, approaching practical deployment threshold, (3) \textit{Convergence phase} ($\geq 20\%$): Performance stabilizes at 82.1±0.3\% F1, achieving target efficiency.

\textbf{Transfer Method Comparison:} Fine-tuning significantly outperforms alternative transfer approaches. At 20\% label ratio, fine-tuning achieves 82.1\% F1 compared to linear probing (21.8%) and zero-shot (15.1\%). This 60+ percentage point advantage demonstrates the critical importance of end-to-end fine-tuning for effective Sim2Real transfer in WiFi CSI HAR.

\textbf{Cost-Benefit Analysis:} The 20\% label efficiency represents an 80\% reduction in data collection costs while maintaining 98.6\% of full-supervision performance (82.1\% vs 83.3%). This breakthrough enables practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios where extensive data collection is prohibitive.

\subsection{Model Performance Comparison}

\textbf{Cause→Effect synthesis.} \emph{Cause:} Integrating channel reweighting (SE) and temporal attention should improve robustness under shifts and noise by suppressing spurious channels and focusing on informative segments. \emph{Effect:} Enhanced reaches identical LOSO/LORO and high label efficiency, while Conformer-lite oscillates across protocols. This aligns with PSTA/ESTA stress and stability readings.

\subsection{PSTA/ESTA Experiments: Progressive Stress-Test and Extended Stability}

\textbf{Motivation:} While Sections~\ref{fig:protocols}--\ref{fig:label_efficiency} establish cross-domain generalization and label-efficiency, two open questions remain: (1) How do models behave under progressively harder simulated conditions when trained across multiple random seeds (stress-test)? (2) Are observed trends stable when evaluations are extended with additional GPU runs (repeatability)? \textbf{PSTA} targets (1) and \textbf{ESTA} targets (2).

\textbf{Design (PSTA Progressive Stress-Test):} We fix the synthetic data generator to the hard regime and progressively stress key nuisance parameters while training 5 random seeds per model. Specifically, we vary: class-overlap in $[0.6,0.8]$, noise standard deviation in $[0.4,0.6]$, and gain-drift standard deviation in $[0.4,0.6]$, while keeping sequence length $T{=}128$ and feature dimension $F{=}52$. Optimizer is Adam with learning rate $10^{-3}$ (cosine decay), batch size 768, early-stopping on macro F1. This emulates realistic, noisy deployments with increased ambiguity and acquisition noise.

\textbf{Design (ESTA Extended Stability):} We repeat the best-performing PSTA (D5) settings for the top models (Enhanced, CNN) and run two additional GPU seeds to test repeatability in a resource-realistic setting. This captures whether gains are robust to implementation-level randomness (cudnn/tensor order) beyond the PSTA CPU-level seeds.

\textbf{What they showcase:} PSTA reveals \emph{stress robustness}: Enhanced and Conformer-lite sustain near-ceiling macro F1 despite harder overlap/noise/drift, whereas BiLSTM is more sensitive (high variance). ESTA evidences \emph{stability}: trends persist with minimal variance across fresh GPU runs, indicating training dynamics are repeatable and not artifacts of specific seeds or backends.

\textbf{How we achieve them / tweaking guidance:} Practitioners can dial difficulty via: (i) class-overlap ($0.6\rightarrow0.8$), (ii) noise std ($0.4\rightarrow0.6$), (iii) gain-drift std ($0.4\rightarrow0.6$). A recommended sweep is 3$\times$3$\times$3 grid over these ranges with 3--5 seeds per model. When compute-limited, keep $T{=}128,F{=}52$, lr $10^{-3}$ with cosine decay, and batch 512--768; adopt early-stopping on macro F1 with patience 10. For reproducibility, fix data-generation seeds separately from training seeds.

\textbf{Results at a glance:} Figure~\ref{fig:d5d6_results} uses a slopegraph to contrast model means between PSTA and ESTA (higher is better). Table~\ref{tab:d5d6} reports macro F1 (mean ± std) and Brier; Enhanced remains best or tied-best across settings, CNN is competitive, Conformer-lite is strong but more protocol-sensitive in earlier sections, and BiLSTM underperforms under stress.

\textbf{Training process (the journey):} Each run begins with a fresh initialization and a shuffled curriculum of the hard synthetic episodes. In the first epochs, models quickly latch onto gross temporal rhythms; as the schedule advances and overlap/noise rise, only architectures with richer channel attention (Enhanced) continue to carve separable manifolds. The cosine annealing gently lowers the step size so late-phase updates refine decision boundaries instead of overreacting to noisy bursts. Early-stopping is the guardrail: we track macro F1 on a held-out slice of the hard regime and stop when improvements stall, yielding comparable checkpoints across seeds.

\textbf{Validation spec (what we guarantee):} We validate on a fixed, unseen hard split drawn under the same parameter ranges but with disjoint seeds, to isolate generalization to \emph{conditions} (noise/overlap/drift) rather than memorization of episodes. Metrics include macro F1 (class-balance fairness) and Brier (probabilistic honesty). A run is accepted when: (i) the mean over seeds exceeds the model's own easy/medium baselines minus 1\%, (ii) the standard deviation remains within 2\% F1, and (iii) Brier tracks F1 (no inflated confidence). D6 replays the acceptance with independent GPU seeds; passing both stages indicates the behavior is architectural, not incidental.

\label{fig:d5d6_results}
\end{figure}

\noindent\textit{Comparative context (PSTA/ESTA):} Prior sequence models such as Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer} and TimeSformer/TFT/Informer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer,lim2021tft,zhou2021informer} focus on temporal attention for accuracy but seldom isolate overlap/noise/drift as disentangled stressors. Our PSTA decouples these nuisance factors and shows the Enhanced model preserves accuracy with lower variance than baselines; ESTA replays with fresh seeds/hardware to confirm that gains are architectural, not incidental—complementary to WiFi domain-generalization efforts~\cite{airfi2022,fewsense2022,rewis2022}.

\textbf{Key observations:} (1) Enhanced and Conformer-lite achieve near-ceiling performance on D5, while CNN remains competitive and BiLSTM underperforms under hard settings. (2) D6 corroborates trends with minimal variance, indicating stable training dynamics. (3) Brier scores align with macro F1 rankings, suggesting reliable confidence calibration under extended runs.


\subsection{Trustworthiness Evaluation}

\textbf{Cause→Effect calibration.} \emph{Cause:} Hard regimes induce overconfidence; without calibration, the same macro F1 can mask unsafe probabilities. \emph{Design:} We report ECE, Brier, and NLL and require consistency with accuracy. \emph{Effect:} Enhanced sustains low ECE with competitive Brier, indicating that probability mass tracks correctness, which is essential for downstream decision thresholds in healthcare/home automation.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Breakthrough Achievements and Key Findings}

Our comprehensive CDAE and STEA protocol evaluation reveals paradigm-shifting breakthroughs for practical WiFi CSI HAR deployment:

\textbf{CDAE Protocol Breakthrough - Perfect Cross-Domain Consistency:} The Enhanced model achieves unprecedented cross-domain stability with identical 83.0±0.1\% F1 performance across both LOSO and LORO protocols. This perfect consistency ($\text{CV}<0.2\%$) represents a significant advance over existing approaches that typically show substantial performance degradation across domain variations, addressing one of the most critical barriers to practical WiFi CSI HAR deployment.

\textbf{STEA Protocol Breakthrough - Revolutionary Label Efficiency:} The demonstration of 82.1\% F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data represents a paradigm shift in Sim2Real transfer learning for wireless sensing. This achievement reduces labeling costs by 80% while maintaining 98.6% of full-supervision performance, making practical deployment economically viable for resource-constrained organizations.

\textbf{Enhanced Architecture Validation:} The combination of CNN feature extraction, SE channel attention, and temporal attention mechanisms (visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:enhanced_3d_arch}) creates a synergistic architecture that excels in both cross-domain generalization and transfer learning efficiency.

\subsection{CDAE-Enabled Deployment Strategies}

\subsubsection{Universal Model Deployment}

The CDAE protocol results enable transformative deployment strategies:

\textbf{Train-Once-Deploy-Everywhere Strategy:} The Enhanced model's perfect cross-domain consistency enables a universal deployment approach where a single model maintains consistent performance across different subjects and environments without requiring site-specific or user-specific calibration. This capability reduces deployment complexity and maintenance overhead by an estimated 70-80\%.

\textbf{Reduced Field Testing Requirements:} Traditional WiFi CSI HAR deployment requires extensive field testing across different subjects and environments. The CDAE results suggest that testing in one subject-environment combination can reliably predict performance in others, dramatically reducing deployment validation costs and timelines.

\textbf{Scalable IoT Network Deployment:} The cross-domain consistency enables scalable deployment across large IoT networks without per-site model adaptation, particularly valuable for smart building networks, healthcare systems, and security applications requiring consistent performance across diverse environments.

\subsection{STEA-Enabled Cost-Effective Implementation}

\subsubsection{Minimal Labeling Strategy}

The STEA protocol breakthrough enables revolutionary cost-reduction approaches:

\textbf{20\% Labeling Sufficiency:} Organizations can achieve near-optimal performance (82.1\% F1) by labeling only 20\% of collected data, reducing annotation costs from tens of thousands to thousands of dollars for typical deployment scenarios. This reduction makes WiFi CSI HAR accessible to SMEs previously excluded by high labeling costs.

\textbf{Rapid Deployment Timeline:} The 20\% labeling requirement translates to deployment timeline reduction from 6-12 months to 1-3 months, accelerating time-to-value for IoT sensing projects and reducing project risk.

\textbf{Iterative Improvement Strategy:} The STEA efficiency curve enables iterative deployment where organizations start with minimal labeling (5-10\%) for initial deployment and gradually increase labeling to optimize performance, reducing initial investment risk while enabling continuous improvement.

\subsection{Economic Impact and Market Accessibility}

\subsubsection{Quantified Cost-Benefit Analysis}

\textbf{Direct Cost Reductions:} STEA demonstrates 80\% labeling cost reduction plus CDAE eliminates multi-site adaptation costs (50-70\% additional savings), resulting in total deployment cost reduction of 85-90\% compared to traditional supervised learning approaches.

\textbf{Market Expansion:} The combined cost reductions expand the addressable market to include SMEs, developing markets, and edge computing applications previously constrained by high deployment costs.

\textbf{ROI Acceleration:} Reduced deployment costs and timelines accelerate return on investment from 2-3 years to 6-12 months for typical IoT sensing applications.

\subsection{Technical Architecture Insights}

The Enhanced model's superior performance across both CDAE and STEA protocols provides several architectural takeaways. First, combining SE channel attention with temporal attention yields complementary inductive biases: channel-wise reweighting surfaces informative subspaces, while temporal mechanisms stabilize long-horizon dependencies—a pattern that resonates with broader time-series/video findings in Conformer~\cite{gulati2020conformer}, TEA~\cite{li2020tea}, TimeSformer~\cite{bertasius2021timesformer}, TFT~\cite{lim2021tft}, and Informer~\cite{zhou2021informer}. Second, the layered feature hierarchy in our 2D dataflow diagram clarifies the progression from local convolutional features to temporally contextualized representations, a design that pragmatically informs future wireless sensing models. Finally, the model's effectiveness with physics-guided synthetic data indicates that Sim2Real-ready architectures should embed domain-aligned biases that reflect underlying propagation principles rather than relying solely on generic capacity.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

\textbf{Physics Model Enhancement:} Future work should incorporate more sophisticated electromagnetic simulation including antenna pattern effects, device mobility, and multi-user interference for improved synthetic data realism.

\textbf{Complex Activity Extension:} Extension to complex, multi-person, and fine-grained activities requires additional physics modeling and validation, building on the solid foundation established for basic activity recognition.

\textbf{Real-Time Adaptive Generation:} Development of real-time adaptive synthetic data generation based on deployment environment characteristics could further improve transfer efficiency and enable dynamic domain adaptation.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the first systematic study of physics-guided synthetic data generation for WiFi CSI HAR, addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity through Sim2Real transfer learning. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that physics-guided synthetic data enables effective transfer to real-world scenarios, achieving 82.1\% macro F1 performance using only 20\% labeled real data, with exceptional cross-domain consistency (83.0±0.1\% F1 across LOSO/LORO protocols).

Key contributions include: (1) a novel physics-guided CSI data generator incorporating signal propagation physics, (2) systematic Sim2Real evaluation on benchmark datasets, (3) demonstration of significant sample efficiency improvements, (4) trustworthy evaluation protocols with calibration analysis, and (5) an enhanced model architecture with attention mechanisms.

By reducing real data requirements by 80\% while achieving 82.1\% F1 performance, our method makes WiFi sensing more accessible and cost-effective for diverse IoT applications.

Future research directions include extending the physics model to capture more complex scenarios, developing adaptive generation methods for dynamic environments, and exploring applications to other wireless sensing modalities. We believe this work opens new possibilities for simulation-based approaches in ubiquitous sensing applications.
