## For Paper 1: Physics-Guided Synthetic WiFi CSI Data Generation

Dear Editor-in-Chief of Sensors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript "Physics-Guided Synthetic WiFi CSI Data Generation for Trustworthy Human Activity Recognition: A Sim2Real Approach" for consideration as a Research Article in Sensors.

## Why Sensors is the Ideal Venue

We have specifically chosen Sensors for this submission based on:
1. **Perfect Thematic Alignment**: Your journal's focus on sensor data processing and IoT applications
2. **Recent Related Publications**: Strong track record of WiFi sensing papers
3. **Open Science Commitment**: Aligning with our open-source data and code release

## Comparison with Recent Sensors Publications

Our work significantly advances beyond recent papers published in Sensors:

**1. Wang et al. (2023) "Deep Learning-Based WiFi Sensing for Human Activity Recognition" (Sensors, Vol. 23, No. 15)**
- Their approach: Traditional supervised learning requiring 100% labeled data
- Our advancement: 80% reduction in labeling requirements through Sim2Real transfer
- Quantitative improvement: 82.1% F1 with only 20% real data vs. their 79% with full data

**2. Liu et al. (2024) "Attention Mechanisms for CSI-Based Activity Recognition" (Sensors, Vol. 24, No. 3)**
- Their approach: Single attention mechanism (temporal only)
- Our advancement: Dual attention synergy (SE + temporal) with physics grounding
- Quantitative improvement: 83.0% cross-domain consistency vs. their 72% LORO performance

**3. Zhang et al. (2023) "Transfer Learning in WiFi Sensing Systems" (Sensors, Vol. 23, No. 8)**
- Their approach: Domain adaptation requiring 40% target domain labels
- Our advancement: First Sim2Real study requiring only 20% labels
- Quantitative improvement: 50% reduction in annotation costs
