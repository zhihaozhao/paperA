Subject: Submission of Review Manuscript "Benchmarking Autonomous Fruit-Picking Robots: Engineering Metrics and Deployment Implications"

Dear Editor,

We submit our engineering-focused review manuscript to Biosystems Engineering.

Scope and contributions:
- PRISMA-guided synthesis (137 studies, 2015–2024) covering sensing, vision, manipulation and motion control with agriculture-oriented constraints.
- Unified engineering metrics and tables (success rate, cycle time, damage rate; power/compute footprints; bill of materials trends) with reproducible CSV and scripts.
- Deployment guidance on robustness under orchard variability, retrofit feasibility, and cost–performance trade-offs.

Fit with the journal:
- Emphasis on agricultural engineering systems, metrics and deployability.

Compliance:
- Original submission; not under consideration elsewhere; all authors approve. Any AI tool was used only for language polishing after analysis.

Sincerely,
Zhihao Zhao (corresponding author)
