Subject: Submission of "Field-Robotics Benchmarks for Autonomous Fruit Picking: Perception-to-Action Integration, Quantitative Trade-offs, and Deployment Guidance"

Dear Editor,

We submit our review manuscript for consideration in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
We provide a PRISMA-guided synthesis (20152024), benchmark-driven quantitative comparisons, and a reproducibility package (CSV + scripts). Emphasis is on field autonomy and quantitative trade-offs.

Compliance: original; not under consideration elsewhere; all authors approve; AI only for language polishing.

Sincerely,
[Your Name], corresponding author
