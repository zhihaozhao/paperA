Subject: Submission of Review Manuscript "Field-Robotics Benchmarks for Autonomous Fruit Picking: Perception-to-Action Integration, Quantitative Trade-offs, and Deployment Guidance"

Dear Editor,

We submit our review manuscript for consideration in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

Positioning and contributions:
- A PRISMA-guided synthesis of 137 studies (2015–2024) covering sensing, vision, planning, and control for autonomous fruit picking, with emphasis on outdoor/greenhouse field conditions.
- Benchmark-driven quantitative comparisons (mAP@0.5, FPS, small-object AP; success rate, cycle time, damage rate) and analysis of perception–planning–control coupling.
- Cross-study gaps and deployment guidance: robustness under occlusion/illumination variability, computation–power constraints on mobile platforms, multi-robot scaling, and reproducibility resources (CSV + scripts).

Fit with RAS:
- Emphasis on field robotics, closed-loop autonomy, and quantitative trade-offs aligns with RAS’s scope on integrated robotic systems.

Compliance:
- The manuscript is original and not under consideration elsewhere. All authors approved the submission. Any AI tool was used solely for language polishing post-analysis; scientific content is authored and verified by the authors.

Sincerely,
Zhihao Zhao (corresponding author)
