\begin{abstract} 
What if robots could harvest fruit as deftly as humans? This paper dives into the latest review of advancements in autonomous fruit-picking robots, zeroing in on visual perception, path planning, and motion control technologies. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, we systematically analyzed 149 relevant studies from 2015 to 2024. 

We've seen how learning-based approaches, particularly those integrating You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Mask Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), boost detection accuracy in visual perception systems, nailing fruit detection and localization even amid challenging conditions like occlusion and variable lighting.
Explicitly, learning-based approaches, including transfer learning and reinforcement learning (e.g., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)), have facilitated the generalizability of robotic arm motion planning for collision-free harvesting. Innovative path-planning algorithms and robust control strategies further enable autonomous robots to navigate unstructured environments and compensate for real-time disturbances, increasing system reliability. 
Despite these advances, challenges remain in multi-source data integration and delicate handling. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of technological strides, identifies research gaps in scalability and deployment, and proposes future directions to guide research and accelerate commercial adoption.

\section{Introduction}
Farms worldwide are grappling with labor shortages, skyrocketing costs, and demands for sustainable methods. Autonomous fruit-picking robots offer a promising answer, drawing on AI, vision tech, and robotics that could streamline harvests while ease worker burdens. Just how close are we to robots that rival human pickers? This review dives in. 

Recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and sensor fusion have enhanced robots' capacity to discern, localize, and manipulate objects with greater precision. These developments have been reviewed and summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:survey_summary}. They have also addressed deficiencies in end-to-end integration.
 Figure ~\ref{fig:struct} illustrates the general architecture of an autonomous fruit-picking robot, highlighting key components such as visual sensors for detection, manipulator arms for grasping, and navigation systems for mobility. This advancement has been particularly evident in addressing challenges such as occlusion, variable lighting, and unstructured orchards.

Existing literature reviews have laid the groundwork for understanding strides in autonomous fruit-picking technologies as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:survey_summary}. These recent surveys, all published since 2021, have collectively advanced the field by addressing various aspects of robotic systems, though they often exhibit limitations in scope and integration.
For instance, Hou et al. \cite{hou2023overview} focused on the integration of deep learning (DL) with multi-sensor vision systems, emphasizing perception sensors and machine vision to enhance fruit detection in unstructured environments. While this work provided valuable insights into AI-driven fusion and trends in field robustness, it overlooked broader system integration and actuation mechanisms. Similarly, Navas et al. \cite{navas2021soft} specialized in soft and bionic gripper designs, advancing understanding of adaptive handling for delicate fruits from a mechanical perspective, but neglected upstream components like perception or downstream integration, resulting in a siloed approach.
In contrast, more comprehensive reviews such as those by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024automatic} and Mingyou et al. \cite{mingyou2024orchard} adopted end-to-end perspectives. Zhang et al. covered machine vision, motion planning, end-effectors, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation, notably including real-time control via IoT/5G and economic feasibility assessments for practical deployment. Mingyou et al. extended this by addressing multi-robot coordination and large-scale perception in expansive orchard settings, innovating with robust mapping and cooperative robotics trends. These works excelled in promoting holistic views but were sometimes constrained by their emphasis on specific deployment scenarios, such as large-scale orchards, potentially limiting applicability to smaller or diverse crop types.
Other surveys, including Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2022intelligent} and Rajendran et al. \cite{rajendran2024towards}, emphasized modular architectures and precision control. Zhou et al. explored machine vision, motion planning, and field adaptation, highlighting vision-driven precision and scalable designs for orchard autonomy, though without delving into mechanical details or cooperative elements. Rajendran et al. integrated perception sensors, machine vision, end-effectors, and field adaptation to discuss dexterous control and selective harvesting synergies, improving real-field reliability, yet their scope was somewhat narrow, focusing on targeted operations without broader multi-crop generalizations. Collectively, these surveys advanced the field by identifying key performance indicators, such as detection accuracy and adaptability metrics, but their fragmentation—often isolating components like perception from action or constraining to specific fruits (e.g., apples or citrus)—left gaps in fully end-to-end frameworks that encompass diverse agricultural contexts.

The survey under discussion addresses the limitations of prior works, including fragmented subsystem analyses, insufficient end-to-end integration, and the absence of unified benchmarking and scalability considerations. It does so by introducing a holistic "perception-action" framework.
We critically evaluate technological breakthroughs, identify persistent challenges, and propose future directions to accelerate commercial adoption.

The core contributions of this survey are thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item A systematic analysis of multi-modal strategies aligned with DL models to enhance detection robustness in diverse agricultural scenarios.

\item A comprehensive quantitative comparison of fruit detection models, evaluating trade-offs in accuracy 
 and efficiency 
, coupled with a dissection of core metrics (reliability, precision, rapidity) from last decade, including strengths 
and limitations 
, to provide decision frameworks and interconnections for holistic optimization.

\item An integrated synthesis of robotic motion control systems and perception-to-action pipelines for fruit harvesting, spanning diverse fruits and strategies from multi-DOF manipulators to visual servoing, quantifying variances 
and interconnections with environmental factors

\item A critical evaluation of collaborative robotic systems, unifying multi-arm coordination with cost-effective designs and benchmarking.
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi-Sensor Fusion and Modality Synergy in Robotic Fruit Picking}

Modern fruit-picking operations are increasingly reliant on precise measurements of plant morphology and depth. Plant morphology encompasses features such as color, shape, edge, 	3D contour, texture, and ripeness of fruits, leaves, peduncle and stems under varying illumination, occlusion, and dynamic conditions—characteristics primarily captured by various visual sensors. For depth characterization of observed targets, distance sensors are additionally required. 
Consequently, fruit-picking robots rely on multi-sensor fusion (as illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:camera}) to acquire diverse features, thereby reducing measurement errors and enhancing robustness.

Among multi-sensor approaches, 3D stereo vision systems are essential by using dual cameras to estimate depth via triangulation, effectively mimicking human binocular vision. Early efforts include Wang et al.~\cite{wang2016localisation}, who developed a binocular stereo vision system for litchi localization, incorporating wavelet transforms and clustering methods to obtain high accuracy under natural lighting. Similarly, Si et al.~\cite{si2015location} advanced apple detection by enabling their stereo vision platform to recognize and localize multiple fruits simultaneously in variable environments. Luo et al.~\cite{luo2016vision} further demonstrated a grape-harvesting stereo system capable of quickly detecting cutting points and estimating yields with high efficiency.
RGB-D cameras which combine color information with depth sensing using time-of-flight or structured light have also proven highly beneficial. Barnea et al.~\cite{barnea2016colour} presented an RGB-D-based 3D detection method capable of analyzing both shape and symmetry, which is effective for sweet pepper harvesting even under complex conditions. Nguyen et al.~\cite{nguyen2016detection} showed that integrating depth with RGB data significantly improves apple detection and localization, especially under occlusion. Kusumam et al.~\cite{kusumam20173d} and Andújar et al.~\cite{andujar2016using} extended these principles to broccoli and cauliflower, using mobile RGB-D platforms to deliver precise 3D crop measurements crucial for automated harvest scheduling.
Sensor fusion extends beyond vision alone: for example, Gongal et al.~\cite{gongal2018apple} used a combination of color and time-of-flight 3D cameras to estimate apple size, demonstrating higher accuracy using pixel size information—an important step forward for volume estimation and crop management.
The integration of visual sensors with advanced algorithms—such as DL models and inverse kinematics—further automates and optimizes fruit detection and harvesting. Onishi et al.~\cite{onishi2019automated} combined a stereo camera with an SSD DL model to gain high real-time detection accuracy, precisely guiding the robot's arm through calculated movements.

While multi-sensor systems, such as 3D stereo vision setups, have significantly advanced agricultural robotics by capturing richer environmental data, their effectiveness remains constrained when relying solely on homogeneous sensor inputs (e.g., visual data from dual cameras). To address this limitation, multi-modality data fusion has emerged as a logical next step, extending beyond the integration of similar sensors to combine fundamentally different types of data. This approach leverages the unique strengths of diverse modalities including visual, spectral, IoT-derived etc. to create a more comprehensive and robust perceptual framework.
For example, Horng et al.~\cite{horng2019smart} developed a crop harvesting system that integrates image recognition with IoT technology. By combining MobileNetV2 and SSD, the system can assess crop maturity with an average precision of 84\% and coordinate the movement of multiaxial robotic arms. This integrated solution automates and optimizes harvesting procedures, leading to increased efficiency and a reduction in labor-intensive tasks.
LiDAR-based data fusion has also shown considerable promise in orchard-scale mapping and monitoring. Underwood et al.~\cite{underwood2016mapping} demonstrated the integration of LiDAR and vision sensors on a mobile robotic platform for almond orchard mapping. This approach enables dynamic 3D mapping of canopy volumes, as well as the capture of data on flower and fruit densities, facilitating automated and season-spanning monitoring. The system revealed a strong predictive correlation between sensor-derived canopy volumes and actual yields, establishing a benchmark for subsequent developments in field robotics.
Further highlighting the advantages of LiDAR technology, Gené-Mola et al.~\cite{gene2019fruit} utilized a mobile terrestrial laser scanner equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 to detect and localize Fuji apples by analyzing reflectance at 905 nm. The method yielded a localization success rate of 87.5\%, an identification success rate of 82.4\%, and an F1-score of 0.858, demonstrating robust performance under various lighting conditions and precise three-dimensional fruit localization. Koenig et al.~\cite{koenig2015comparative} conducted a comparative analysis of post-harvest growth detection using terrestrial LiDAR point clouds, obtaining 99\% precision with 0.0\% error. Their work underscores the effectiveness of combining geometric and radiometric features and demonstrates the utility of LiDAR in weed management for precision agriculture.

Collectively, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tab:dataset}, multi-modality synergy enhances the capabilities of fruit-picking robots by providing accurate data for detection and harvesting, though limitations persist in diverse agricultural applications

\section{Advances in Visual Perception for Fruit-Picking Robotics}

Visual perception represents the foundation of autonomous fruit-picking systems, enabling accurate detection, localization, and assessment of fruits in complex orchard environments. Our meta-analysis of 149 studies reveals significant advances across multiple algorithmic families, with clear performance trade-offs and emerging optimization strategies.

\begin{figure*}[htbp]

\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{plot_4s/figures/visual_perception_meta_analysis.png}
\caption{Meta-analysis of visual perception advances in fruit-picking robotics (2015-2024). This comprehensive visualization synthesizes performance metrics from 149 studies across multiple dimensions: (a) Algorithm performance distribution showing accuracy vs. processing time trade-offs for major detection frameworks (R-CNN family, YOLO series, and segmentation methods), with bubble sizes representing citation impact; (b) Temporal evolution of detection accuracy improvements, highlighting the rapid advancement in deep learning approaches; (c) Multi-modal sensor fusion effectiveness matrix comparing RGB, RGB-D, LiDAR, and hyperspectral approaches across different fruit types; (d) Performance-challenge correlation analysis identifying key bottlenecks in occlusion handling, illumination variance, and real-time processing requirements.

\label{fig:visual_perception_meta}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:visual_perception_meta} presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of visual perception advances, synthesizing performance data from our systematic review. The visualization reveals several critical insights:

\textbf{Algorithm Performance Landscape (Panel a):} The scatter plot demonstrates the fundamental trade-off between detection accuracy and processing speed across different algorithmic families. R-CNN variants cluster in the high-accuracy, moderate-speed region (85-98\% accuracy, 100-500ms processing time), while YOLO-based approaches occupy the high-speed, good-accuracy space (80-95\% accuracy, 10-100ms processing time). Segmentation-specific methods show the highest precision (90-99\% accuracy) but with variable processing speeds depending on implementation complexity.

\textbf{Temporal Evolution (Panel b):} The timeline analysis reveals accelerated progress post-2020, coinciding with the widespread adoption of attention mechanisms and transformer architectures. Detection accuracy improvements have plateaued around 95-98\% for optimal conditions, suggesting that future advances must focus on robustness rather than peak performance.

\textbf{Multi-Modal Effectiveness (Panel c):} The sensor fusion matrix demonstrates that RGB-D combinations achieve the best balance of performance across fruit types, while LiDAR integration provides superior depth accuracy for large fruits but struggles with small berries.

\label{fig:motion_control_meta}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{fig:motion_control_meta} presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of motion control advances, revealing key insights into algorithmic evolution and performance characteristics:

\textbf{Success Rate vs. Cycle Time Analysis (Panel a):} Classical algorithms (A*, RRT, Dijkstra) achieve moderate success rates (60-80\%) with predictable cycle times (15-25 seconds), while reinforcement learning approaches (DDPG, deep RL) demonstrate higher success rates (75-92\%) with improved adaptability but variable cycle times. Hybrid systems combining classical planning with learning-based refinement achieve optimal performance (85-95\% success, 6-12 second cycles).

\textbf{Algorithmic Evolution (Panel b):} The timeline reveals a clear transition from traditional geometric path planning (2015-2018) to learning-based approaches (2019-2024), with hybrid systems emerging as the dominant paradigm post-2021. This evolution reflects the field's recognition that pure algorithmic approaches cannot handle the complexity of unstructured agricultural environments.

\textbf{Environmental Adaptability (Panel c):} Performance analysis across different fruit types and environmental conditions shows that structured environments (greenhouses) enable higher success rates (80-95\%) compared to unstructured orchards (60-85\%). Sweet pepper and tomato harvesting achieve the highest success rates due to predictable growth patterns, while apple and citrus harvesting in dense canopies remain challenging.

\textbf{Vision-Motion Integration (Panel d):} The correlation matrix demonstrates that tight coupling between visual perception and motion control significantly improves overall harvesting success (correlation coefficient: 0.82), emphasizing the importance of end-to-end system design rather than isolated component optimization.
