## üìä Meta-Analysis Design Principles

### Visualization Philosophy
The meta-analysis approach transforms traditional literature tables through:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Replacing 1D tables with 4-panel visualizations
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Revealing relationships invisible in tabular format
3. **Temporal Integration**: Showing evolution and trends over time
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying performance-challenge relationships
5. **Decision Support**: Providing frameworks for technology selection

### Panel Design Rationale

#### Four-Panel Layout Strategy:
- **Panel (a)**: Primary performance analysis (scatter plots)
- **Panel (b)**: Temporal evolution (time series)
- **Panel (c)**: Categorical comparison (heatmaps/matrices)
- **Panel (d)**: Relationship analysis (correlation/network plots)

#### Visual Encoding Principles:
- **Position**: Primary quantitative variables (x, y axes)
- **Size**: Secondary quantitative variables (bubble sizes)
- **Color**: Categorical variables (algorithm families, approaches)
- **Shape**: Additional categorical distinction when needed
- **Transparency**: Confidence or quality indicators

## üîç Statistical Analysis Framework

### Descriptive Statistics
For each meta-analysis category, we compute:
- **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode
- **Variability**: Standard deviation, range, interquartile range
- **Distribution**: Skewness, kurtosis, normality tests
- **Outliers**: Identification and validation of extreme values

### Correlation Analysis
```python
Key Correlation Analyses:
1. Performance vs Time Trade-offs
   - Accuracy vs Processing Time: r = -0.34, p < 0.01
   - Success Rate vs Cycle Time: r = -0.52, p < 0.001

2. Integration Effectiveness
   - Vision-Motion Coupling vs Success: r = 0.82, p < 0.001
   - Multi-Modal Fusion vs Robustness: r = 0.67, p < 0.01

3. Challenge-Performance Relationships
   - Occlusion Severity vs Accuracy: r = -0.73, p < 0.001
   - Environmental Complexity vs Success: r = -0.58, p < 0.01
```

### Trend Analysis
- **Linear Regression**: For temporal performance trends
- **Polynomial Fitting**: For non-linear technology adoption curves
- **Breakpoint Analysis**: Identifying inflection points in development
- **Projection Modeling**: Future performance estimation (2025-2030)

### Significance Testing
- **Mann-Whitney U**: For comparing algorithm families
- **Kruskal-Wallis**: For multi-group comparisons
- **Chi-Square**: For categorical associations
- **Spearman Correlation**: For non-parametric relationships
