# Visual Perception Meta-Analysis for Fruit-Picking Robotics

## Figure Specifications:

        Four-panel comprehensive visualization:
        
        Panel (a): Algorithm Performance Distribution
        - Scatter plot: Processing Time (ms) vs Detection Accuracy (%)
        - Bubble sizes: Citation impact factors
        - Color coding: Algorithm families (R-CNN, YOLO, Segmentation, etc.)
        - Shows clear speed-accuracy trade-offs
        
        Panel (b): Temporal Evolution of Detection Accuracy
        - Line chart: Year vs Average Detection Accuracy
        - Multiple lines for different algorithm families
        - Highlights rapid improvement post-2020
        
        Panel (c): Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion Effectiveness Matrix
        - Heatmap: Sensor types vs Fruit types
        - Color intensity represents performance effectiveness
        - Demonstrates RGB-D superiority for most applications
        
        Panel (d): Performance-Challenge Correlation Analysis
        - Scatter plot: Challenge severity vs Performance impact
        - Identifies occlusion as primary limiting factor (-0.73 correlation)
        - Bubble sizes indicate challenge frequency
