What if robots could harvest fruit as deftly as humans? This paper dives into the latest review of advancements in autonomous fruit-picking robots, zeroing in on visual perception, path planning, and motion control technologies. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, we systematically analyzed 149 relevant studies from 2015 to 2024.

We've seen how learning-based approaches, particularly those integrating You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Mask Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), boost detection accuracy in visual perception systems, nailing fruit detection and localization even amid challenging conditions like occlusion and variable lighting.
%The advent of autonomous fruit-picking robots has precipitated a paradigm shift in contemporary agriculture, with the potential to address the prevailing labour shortage and enhance harvesting efficiency. This review comprehensively surveys recent progress in fruit-picking robotics, focusing on vision-based detection, learning-based strategies, arm motion planning, and collision avoidance. Employing a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-based systematic methodology, over 130 influential studies from 2015â€“2024 were analysed. Recent advances in vision-based detection, including multi-sensor fusion and 3D data acquisition, have enhanced robots' ability to localise and identify fruits under complex agricultural conditions.
%Deep learning (DL) models, such as Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, have demonstrated efficacy in enhancing real-time detection performance, particularly under occlusion and variable lighting.
%The efficacy of deep learning (DL) models, such as the Regions with Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, has been demonstrated in enhancing real-time detection performance, particularly in scenarios where there is occlusion and variable lighting.
Explicitly, learning-based approaches, including transfer learning and reinforcement learning (e.g., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)), have facilitated the generalizability of robotic arm motion planning for collision-free harvesting. Innovative path-planning algorithms and robust control strategies further enable autonomous robots to navigate unstructured environments and compensate for real-time disturbances, increasing system reliability.
Despite these advances, challenges remain in multi-source data integration and delicate handling. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of technological strides, identifies research gaps in scalability and deployment, and proposes future directions to guide research and accelerate commercial adoption.
