cas-dc.cls and cas-common.sty are the new class and style files, respectively 
created for typesetting Elsevier's JESTECH journal articles which go through 
Complex Article Service (CAS) workflow. These are now accepted for 
submitting articles, both in Elsevier's electronic submission system and elsewhere.

Bugs and problems with cas-dc.cls and cas-common.sty may be reported to the
developers of the class and style via elsarticle@stmdocs.in.

The file manifest.txt provides a list of the files in the els-cas-templates bundle. 
The following are the main files available:

- cas-dc-template.tex, template file for double column journals
- cas-dc-template.pdf, PDF of the cas-dc-template.tex
- cas-dc.cls, class file
- cas-common.sty, additional macro package for formatting
- elsarticle-num.bst or cas-model2-names.bst, BibTeX style files

The documentation file is elsdoc-cas.tex in the doc directory. To
compile it:

1. pdflatex elsdoc-cas
2. pdflatex elsdoc-cas
3. pdflatex elsdoc-cas

or

use the makefile. Use the target `all' (eg: make all) in doc
directory.

The above procedure will create a print version, namely elsdoc-cas.pdf.
