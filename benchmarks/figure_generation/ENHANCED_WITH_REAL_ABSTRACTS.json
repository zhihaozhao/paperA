A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels.",
