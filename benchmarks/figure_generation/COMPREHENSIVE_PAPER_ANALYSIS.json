      "abstract": "Camellia oleifera is an oilseed crop with high economic value. The short optimum harvest period and high labour costs of C. oleifera harvesting have prompted research on intelligent robotic harvesting. This study focused on the determination of grabbing points for the robotic harvesting of C. oleifera fruits, providing a basis for the decision making of the fruit-picking robot. A relatively simple 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) and stereoscopic vision replaced the complex 3D CNN to realise the 3D positioning of the fruit. Apple datasets were used for the pretraining of the model and knowledge transfer, which shared a certain degree of similarity to C. oleifera fruit. In addition, a fully automatic coordinate conversion method has been proposed to transform the fruit position information in the image into its 3D position in the robot coordinate system. Results showed that the You Only Look Once (YOLO)v8x model trained using 1012 annotated samples achieved the highest performance for fruit detection, with mAP50 of 0.96 on the testing dataset. With knowledge transfer based on the apple datasets, YOLOv8x using few-shot learning realised a testing mAP50 of 0.95, reducing manual annotation. Moreover, the error in the 3D coordinate calculation was lower than 2.1 cm on the three axes. The proposed method provides the 3D coordinates of the grabbing point for the target fruit in the robot coordinate system, which can be transferred directly to the robot control system to execute fruit-picking actions. This dataset was published online to reproduce the results of this study.",

      "abstract": "The dynamic non-destructive grasp of thin-skinned fruits using flexible robotic hands, which requires obtaining three-dimension(3D) spatial structure information along with adaptive planning and motion control toward the target object, is a challenging topic in agricultural intelligence. To tackle the issue of 3D detection, we utilize RGB images and LiDAR point clouds for feature extraction and construct a multi-modal depth fusion convolution neural network (MDF-CNN) to obtain the classification information and perform image segmentation. Incorporating the advantages of a variable palm structure, we establish an evaluation mechanism of the optimal grasping stability (EM-OGS) using a hybrid method of the best configuration and force closure to build a new comprehensive performance optimal configuration planning (CPO-CP) method that is based on the multiple grasping performance indexes. We also create three cross-related nonlinear prediction models P-MGF, P-ODAP, and P-OBA along with a forward-looking non-destructive grasp control algorithm (FL-NGCA) using minimum grasping force to grasp thin-skinned fruits. The control algorithm carries out online, self-directed learning in the actual grasping process of the flexible hand and constantly optimizes the accuracy of the prediction model. Experimental results show that our proposed approach greatly improves the flexible hand comprehensive performance of grasping, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for non-destructive grasping of delicate fruits in most areas.",

      "abstract": "In the agricultural sector worldwide, there is a need for more human labor in fruit harvesting and processing operations, requiring advanced technologies like human–robot collaboration (HRC), where robots collaborate with humans to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity. In this context, we propose a new end-to-end vision-based detection, tracking, and classification (DTC) architecture enabling robots to assist human pickers in fruit-picking operations. The proposed solution includes using RGB-D camera perception, customized convolutional and recurrent neural network models, and pose estimation to detect, track, and classify the activities of human pickers from continuous streaming data captured in different seasons. It also provides a module for location estimation of the human pickers, allowing the robot to navigate to the estimated goal and assist them in real-time with logistic tasks during harvesting. The authors contribute a new video dataset of real fruit-picking operations under suboptimal conditions, which is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Simulation results, obtained from the collected experimental dataset, show that the overall time required to compute insights-to-action is around six seconds for challenging scenarios such as multiple human pickers in the scene. This research aims to establish a baseline, end-to-end AI pipeline of insight predictions to prescriptive robot actions in fruit-picking operations to reduce workers’ working time and physical fatigue in logistics operations in the field. The authors expect this study to be used further to improve and develop anticipatory scheduling of robots methodology to save time and energy for pickers in logistics activities. The vision-based DTC architecture presents a reliable and cost-effective solution to address the scarcity of human labor in agriculture by facilitating the collaboration between humans and robots in fruit-picking tasks, as shown by simulations in the ROS-Gazebo framework.",

Potential future research perspectives are identified through a comprehensive literature analysis. These include combining cutting-edge deep learning and multi-vision and multi-modal sensors to potentially apply them in real-time for apple harvesting robots. Additionally, utilizing 3D vision for a thorough analysis of complex and dynamic orchard environments, and precise determination of fruit locations using point cloud data and depth information are presented.

      "abstract": "Visual perception has become a prerequisite for automated jujube harvesting robot operations under complex orchard conditions. Catch-and-Shake harvesting, as the most efficient and common harvesting method, has widely been applied on various manually operated harvesters to complete large-area jujube fruit harvesting. However, the main factors restricting the development of existing harvesters are labor shortage, high labor cost, and low operating efficiency. To address the issues, we designed a catch-and-shake harvesting robot for jujube tree trunks and branches visual perception that can provide a barrier-free catch-and-shake operation area and guide the manipulator to reach the area to complete the harvesting operation. Meanwhile, a visual perception system including tree trunks and branches detection, skeleton extraction, catch-and-shake area confirmation was presented to guide robot intelligent operations. In the visual perception system, a novel salientobjectdetectionmodel called feature intersection and fusion Transformer (FIT-Transformer) network was proposed to split branches and background to provide reference for determining safe catch-and-shake areas. Moreover, we designed a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) and an attention feature fusion module (AFFM) to strengthen feature learning capabilities and obtain robust perception models. Comparative experimental results showed that our proposed FIT-Transformer model outperformed 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms including C2FNet, RAS, BASNet, U2Net, SCRNet, PiCANet, EDRNet, EGNet, ICONR, VST, TransSOD and ABiU_Net. Specifically, the segmentation accuracy of jujube tree trunks and branches using our method showed the satisfactory result on five evaluation indexes under natural environment (the EM, SM, WF, FM and MAE reached 0.9713, 0.8991, 0.8854, 0.8905, and 0.0302, respectively). Field experiments also proved that our method could meet the requirements of operational accuracy and real-time operations.",

      "abstract": "Phenotyping is a systematic process of quantifying and assessing a wide range of structural and physiological traits to understand the intricate interplay between an organism’s genetic makeup, its surrounding environment, and management practices, often referred to as genome-to-environment (GxE) interaction. In the context of plants, these traits can include aspects such as plant height, stem diameter, leaf size, angle, and shape, chlorophyll content, biomass, leaf area, etc. 3D plant phenotyping plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of plant biology, improving crop breeding, and agricultural practices. 3D imaging has become a powerful phenotyping tool, offering in-depth insights into plant structures and traits. In contrast to 2D imaging, 3D imaging enables precise measurement of plant traits that cannot be sufficiently evaluated in two dimensions by overcoming challenges such as partial occlusion through the utilization of depth perception and multiple viewpoints. However, even with significant recent progress, various challenges persist, including the need for well-designed experimental setups for standardized data collection, the automation of processing pipelines, and the robust analysis techniques of 3D representations, which still impede the widespread adoption of 3D plant phenotyping. To propel the progress of 3D imaging-based phenotyping, an all-encompassing assessment of existing strategies is imperative, yet there is currently a lack of specialized reviews that scrutinize and emphasize distinct facets for future enhancement. To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic survey of 81 research studies that employ 3D imaging for various trait assessments of plants. Our review thoroughly investigates the stages of data acquisition, encompassing sensing technologies, representations, preprocessing approaches, analysis methodologies, and techniques for estimating phenotypic traits. We believe that this comprehensive review will serve as a valuable guide for researchers and professionals engaged in high throughput plant phenotyping, equipping them to formulate effective experimental setups and utilize appropriate processing and analysis methods, thereby fostering its continued advancement.",

      "abstract": "The recognition and localization of fruit tree trunks in orchard are important for orchard operation robots, which are the bases for automatic navigation, fruit tree spraying and fertilization etc. A method was proposed based on machine vision to detect target objects such as fruit tree trunks, person and supporters in orchard by improving the YOLOv5 deep learning algorithm in this paper, which is applicable to the recognition tasks in natural orchard environments. Firstly, 1354 images of the natural orchard collected by camera were image enhanced, weather effects such as rain, snow, bright light, shadow and fog were added to expand the dataset and to increase the robustness of the model. Secondly, the original YOLOv5 model was improved by replacing the Bottleneck network in the C3 module with the lightweight GhostNet V2 to reduce the network parameters, and changing the box loss function CIoU to SIoU in the loss function to make the regression of the detection box more accurate, and coordinate attention mechanism (CA) was added to the network to reduce the interference of useless background information in images. Before training, pre-anchor boxes were generated by using IoU-based K-means clustering, after that the dataset was fed into the improved YOLOv5 for training, and the trained model was used to detect the trunks. Finally, weighted boxes fusion (WBF) was used instead of the non-maximum suppression (NMS) in this paper for the output of the detection boxes. Then the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for trunk clustering. The improved target detection method was trained and validated on the experimental dataset. The model size is reduced by 43.6 %, model parameters are reduced by 46.9 %, and the mAP reaches 97.1 %, with an average detection speed of 198.2 ms per image. Compared with the original YOLOv5, the model is more lightweight, the detection accuracy and speed are improved. The improved YOLOv5 is also better than YOLOv3, NanoDet and SSD in terms of combined accuracy and speed, and has similar performance to YOLO_MobileNet in orchard dataset. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5 target detection model proposed in this paper is lightweight while still having better detection accuracy and detection speed in complex environments, and the model is small enough to be deployed to mobile or low-performance terminals for target detection in natural orchard environments.",

      "abstract": "A Multi-scale Feature Adaptive Fusion model (MFAF-YOLO) for real-time detection of citrus harvesting robots in complex field environments is proposed in this study. This proposed model improves detection accuracy while meeting the lightweight requirements of consumer-level cameras. In this study, different citrus fruit varieties, sourced from two distinct devices, are classified into ‘First priority’, ‘Second priority’, and unannotated citrus. This classification strategy guides robots in sequential picking in real-field scenarios, reducing detection redundancy and diminishing the damage rate at the robot end-effector. Additionally, multiple clustering algorithms were employed to adjust the anchor box sizes of the model. The impact of dual and triple detection heads on model accuracy across diverse clustering algorithms was also explored. An innovative multi-scale feature adaptive fusion module was embedded in the model's neck section, aiming to optimize model accuracy and reduce model size. In the dataset processed with multiple augmentation techniques, the novel MFAF-YOLO model achieved the mean Average Precision (mAP) of 90.2 %, reflecting an improvement of 3.8 % compared to the original YOLOv5s model, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. Compared with seven other mainstream models, including YOLOv4 and MobileNet-YOLOv5s, the Average Precision (AP) value of ‘First priority’ and ‘Second priority’ is 93.2 % and 87.3 %, respectively, achieved the highest AP while maintaining a better detection speed. The model size of MFAF-YOLO is reduced to 10.4 MB, marking a 26.2 % decrease relative to the lightweight YOLOv5s model. Experimental results highlight the model's strong robustness and successful attainment of an effective balance between model accuracy and lightweight.

      "abstract": "Identifying defects in citrus peels and analyzing fruit morphology are two core challenges in citrus quality inspection. In order to more accurately identify minor defects on citrus peels, we proposed a detection model Yolo-FD (Yolo for defects). The model was based on the Yolov5 network framework, and the backbone network embedded the Three-dimensional Coordinate Attention (TDCA) mechanism innovatively designed in this study. It accurately captured the subtle changes and feature associations of the target in spatial location, significantly enhancing the model's ability to perceive defects in fruit peels. Moreover, we employed a simplified Bidirectional Weighted Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) in the model to achieve cross-scale connections and improve the feature fusion ability of the model. At the same time, Contextual Transformer block (COT) was introduced into Neck network and the CoT3 module was built to fully capture the static and dynamic contextual information in the citrus defects images and enhance the expression of the feature map. Through this series of improvement methods, missed detections and false detections caused by small targets were effectively reduced. Fruit morphology detection was combined with the Partice Swarm Optimized Extreme Learning Machine (PSO-ELM) model to determine whether the citrus fruit morphology was well-formed, using the symmetry index, roundness and tilt angle of the citrus as input parameters. The experimental results indicated that the mean average precision of the Yolo-FD model is 98.7 % (mAP-0.5). Compared with Yolov5s, Yolov7-tiny, and Yolov8n, the mAP was improved by 1.4 %, 1.5 %, and 0.5 % respectively. Its average detection time for a single frame image on the server was 19.5 ms. And the PSO-ELM model achieved a fruit morphology detection accuracy of 91.42 %, a coefficient of determination of 0.9044, and a mean squared error of 0.8497. The research results met the accuracy and real-time requirements for citrus sorting on the production line, and could provide an effective solution for citrus grading and quality assessment.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a control scheme for aerial manipulators which allows to solve different motion problems: end-effector position control, end-effector trajectory tracking control and path-following control. The scheme has two cascaded controllers: i) the first controller is a minimum norm controller based on numerical methods, it solves the three motion control problems just by modifying the controller references. Also, since the aerial manipulator robot is a redundant system, i.e., it has extra degrees of freedom to accomplish the task, it is possible to set other control objectives in a hierarchical order. As a secondary objective of the control it is proposed to maintain a desired configuration for the robotic arm during the task. ii) The second cascade controller is designed to compensate the dynamics of the system which main objective is to drive the velocity errors to zero. The coupled dynamic model of the robotic system (hexarotor and robotic arm) is presented. This model is usually developed as a function of the forces and torques. However, in this work, it is written as a function of reference velocities which are usual references for these vehicles. The proposed control algorithms are given with the corresponding stability and robustness analysis. Finally, to validate the control scheme, experimental tests are performed in a partially structured environment with an aerial manipulator conformed by an aerial platform and a 3DOF robotic arm.",
