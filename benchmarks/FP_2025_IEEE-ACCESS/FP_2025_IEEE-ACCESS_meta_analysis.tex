\section{Introduction}
Agricultural systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges including persistent labor shortages, escalating operational costs, and increasing demands for sustainable harvesting methodologies. Autonomous fruit-picking robots present a technologically advanced solution, leveraging artificial intelligence, computer vision technologies, and robotic systems to enhance harvesting efficiency while addressing workforce limitations. This thorough review methodically examines the current technological readiness and performance capabilities of autonomous fruit-picking systems relative to human harvesting benchmarks.

Recent technological breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and multi-sensor fusion have significantly enhanced robotic systems' capabilities for object detection, localization, and precise manipulation. These developments have been systematically reviewed and summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:survey_summary}, demonstrating substantial progress in addressing traditional limitations in end-to-end system integration.
%The advent of autonomous fruit-picking robots signifies a substantial advancement in agricultural technology, precipitated by the necessity to address labor shortages, escalating costs, and the demand for enhanced efficiency in fruit production.
%Rapid advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have catalyzed substantial interest in developing fruit-picking robots. These robots promise to revolutionize agricultural practices by automating labor-intensive fruit harvesting. Fruit-picking robots are autonomous systems engineered to identify, locate, and harvest fruits from various trees and plants. 
%These systems leverage advanced technologies, including computer vision, machine learning (ML), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), to operate efficiently in diverse agricultural environments, handle fruits delicately, and complement human labor.
%These systems leverage a suite of advanced technologies, including computer vision, machine learning (ML), robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT). The aim is to create robots that can operate efficiently in various agricultural environments, handle fruits delicately to avoid damage, and work alongside human labor to enhance productivity. 
%like Figure~\ref{fig:fruit_picking_robot_overview}.
%Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) and sensor fusion have facilitated the development of sophisticated perception and motion control mechanisms, enabling robots to detect, localize, and harvest fruits with increasing precision.
 Figure ~\ref{fig:struct} illustrates the general architecture of an autonomous fruit-picking robot, highlighting key components such as visual sensors for detection, manipulator arms for grasping, and navigation systems for mobility. This advancement has been particularly evident in addressing challenges such as occlusion, variable lighting, and unstructured orchards.

Existing literature reviews have laid the groundwork for understanding strides in autonomous fruit-picking technologies as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:survey_summary}. These recent surveys, all published since 2021, have collectively advanced the field by addressing various aspects of robotic systems, though they often exhibit limitations in scope and integration.
For instance, Hou et al. \cite{hou2023overview} focused on the integration of deep learning (DL) with multi-sensor vision systems, emphasizing perception sensors and machine vision to enhance fruit detection in unstructured environments. While this work provided valuable insights into AI-driven fusion and trends in field robustness, it overlooked broader system integration and actuation mechanisms. Similarly, Navas et al. \cite{navas2021soft} specialized in soft and bionic gripper designs, advancing understanding of adaptive handling for delicate fruits from a mechanical perspective, but neglected upstream components like perception or downstream integration, resulting in a siloed approach.
In contrast, more extensive reviews such as those by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024automatic} and Mingyou et al. \cite{mingyou2024orchard} adopted end-to-end perspectives. Zhang et al. covered machine vision, motion planning, end-effectors, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation, notably including real-time control via IoT/5G and economic feasibility assessments for practical deployment. Mingyou et al. extended this by addressing multi-robot coordination and large-scale perception in expansive orchard settings, innovating with robust mapping and cooperative robotics trends. These works excelled in promoting holistic views but were sometimes constrained by their emphasis on specific deployment scenarios, such as large-scale orchards, potentially limiting applicability to smaller or diverse crop types.
Other surveys, including Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2022intelligent} and Rajendran et al. \cite{rajendran2024towards}, emphasized modular architectures and precision control. Zhou et al. explored machine vision, motion planning, and field adaptation, highlighting vision-driven precision and scalable designs for orchard autonomy, though without delving into mechanical details or cooperative elements. Rajendran et al. integrated perception sensors, machine vision, end-effectors, and field adaptation to discuss dexterous control and selective harvesting synergies, improving real-field reliability, yet their scope was somewhat narrow, focusing on targeted operations without broader multi-crop generalizations. Collectively, these surveys advanced the field by identifying key performance indicators, such as detection accuracy and adaptability metrics, but their fragmentation—often isolating components like perception from action or constraining to specific fruits (e.g., apples or citrus)—left gaps in fully end-to-end frameworks that encompass diverse agricultural contexts.
%This section reviews the primary contributions of some key surveys, highlighting their scopes and insights, followed by a discussion of their collective limitations, which motivate the innovations in this paper.
%Hou et al. \cite{hou2023overview}  focused on the integration of deep learning (DL) with multi-sensor vision systems. Their survey emphasized perception sensors and machine vision, detailing how AI-driven fusion enhances fruit detection in unstructured environments. This work highlighted trends in field robustness but overlooked broader system integration and actuation mechanisms.
%Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024automatic}  provided an end-to-end perspective on automation chains, covering machine vision, motion planning, end-effectors, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation. A notable contribution was the inclusion of real-time control via IoT/5G and economic feasibility assessments, offering a holistic view of practical deployment.
%Navas et al. \cite{navas2021soft} specialized in soft and bionic gripper designs, concentrating exclusively on end-effectors. Their analysis advanced understanding of adaptive handling for delicate fruits, drawing from mechanical perspectives, though it neglected upstream components like perception or downstream integration.
%Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2022intelligent} explored modular architectures, with emphasis on machine vision, motion planning, and field adaptation. Key insights included vision-driven precision and robot autonomy in orchards, promoting scalable designs that enhance adaptability without delving into mechanical details or cooperative elements.
%Mingyou et al. \cite{mingyou2024orchard}  addressed multi-robot coordination and large-scale perception, covering machine vision, motion planning, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation. This survey innovated by focusing on robust mapping and execution in expansive orchard settings, incorporating cooperative robotics trends.
%Rajendran et al. \cite{rajendran2024towards} integrated perception sensors, machine vision, end-effectors, and field adaptation to discuss precision and dexterous control. Their contribution centered on selective harvesting synergies, improving real-field reliability for targeted operations.

%While these surveys collectively advance the discourse on fruit-picking robotics, several limitations persist that hinder a fully integrated and forward-looking understanding of the field. First, many exhibit a narrow temporal scope or outdated coverage; 
%While prior surveys have advanced the field as summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:survey_summary}, they exhibit limitations that our work addresses. 
%For instance, many have a narrow temporal scope, focusing predominantly on literature before 2020 and overlooking recent breakthroughs in DL models like YOLOv8.
% Zhou et al. and Navas et al. end in 2021, missing pivotal post-2022 developments in AI and multimodal sensing. Hou et al. and Rajendran et al. extend to 2022-2023 but underexplore emerging trends like unified benchmarking or cost-feasibility analyses, which are critical for industrial translation.
%A deeper issue is the siloed focus on specific subsystems: Navas et al. isolates end-effectors without linking to perception-action loops, while Hou et al. prioritizes vision but ignores motion planning and mechanical automation. This fragmentation leads to incomplete end-to-end frameworks, as seen in the absence of system integration in several works (e.g., Hou, Navas, Zhou, and Rajendran). Moreover, cooperative robotics and benchmarking are inconsistently addressed. Mingyou et al. touches on multi-robot aspects, but others largely omit them, resulting in a lack of standardized evaluation metrics for cross-study comparisons. Zhang et al. makes strides in economic feasibility, yet this is not uniformly integrated across surveys, often overlooking practical barriers like deployment costs and scalability in diverse agricultural contexts.
% Additionally, several adopt a siloed approach, emphasizing isolated aspects such as detection or grasping without integrating them into a cohesive end-to-end framework. This fragmentation underscores gaps in holistic analyses, which we bridge through a 'perception-action' approach that encompasses multi-sensor fusion, visual perception, and motion control.
%These limitations collectively underscore a gap in synthesizing multimodal fusion, perception-action integration, and roadmap-oriented guidance for future research. Without addressing these, the field risks redundant efforts and delayed real-world adoption.

The survey under discussion addresses the limitations of prior works, including fragmented subsystem analyses, insufficient end-to-end integration, and the absence of unified benchmarking and scalability considerations. It does so by introducing a holistic "perception-action" framework.
We critically evaluate technological breakthroughs, identify persistent challenges, and propose future directions to accelerate commercial adoption.
%Drawing from the foundational insights of surveys like Hou et al. on deep learning fusion, Zhang et al. on complete automation chains, and Mingyou et al. on multi-robot coordination, this paper emphasizes synergistic integrations that bridge gaps in real-world applicability. 
%Specifically, it focuses on: (1) multi-modal sensor fusion (integrating IoT, remote sensing, and vision \cite{mohamed2021smart,martos2021ensuring,liu2024hierarchical}) with advanced DL models (e.g., evolved YOLO architectures) to overcome detection fragility in dynamic environments, extending beyond the vision-centric approaches in Hou et al. and Rajendran et al.; (2) linking visual perception outputs (e.g., fruit stem localization \cite{li2023mta}) with adaptive path planning (e.g., LiDAR-fused trajectory optimization \cite{liu2024hierarchical}) for seamless operations in unstructured terrain, addressing siloed motion planning in Zhou et al. and Mingyou et al.; and (3) incorporating collaborative robotics principles \cite{lytridis2021overview,li2023multi} alongside system-level efficiency and cost-feasibility analyses to tackle scalability challenges overlooked in component-focused reviews like Navas et al.

The core contributions of this survey are thus:
\begin{itemize}

\subsection{Segmentation Techniques: Enhancing Precision in Complex Environments}
%Recent advancements in DL have notably improved fruit detection and segmentation, addressing longstanding challenges in agricultural robotics such as varying lighting, occlusion, and complex backgrounds. Through continual development and the adaptation of neural network architectures, segmentation networks now support enhanced autonomy and operational performance in fruit-picking robots.
Transitioning from bounding-box-based detection in YOLO to more granular analysis, semantic and instance segmentation techniques further refine visual perception by classifying pixels and segmenting individual instances. Unlike earlier subsections that focused on detection pipelines, this part emphasizes segmentation's role in enabling robots to assess fruit maturity and plan occlusion-aware paths.

Initial efforts in fruit segmentation largely relied on color, shape, and edge features, establishing foundational approaches that would later inform more sophisticated detection systems. Lu and Sang~\cite{lu2015detecting} developed innovative techniques for detecting citrus fruits under natural light conditions, utilizing color properties, contour fragments, and ellipse fitting methodologies to achieve robust segmentation and identification capabilities despite significant occlusion challenges. Building upon these color-based approaches, Lehnert et al.~\cite{lehnert2016sweet} advanced the field by integrating color segmentation with 3D clustering algorithms to estimate sweet pepper pose estimation, enabling precise robotic grasping operations with 6-DOF manipulator systems. Wang et al.~\cite{wang2017robust} further enhanced segmentation robustness under variable illumination conditions through systematic integration of wavelet-based normalization, Retinex image enhancement techniques, and K-means clustering algorithms, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall detection accuracy across diverse environmental conditions.

With the progress of DL, CNNs and fully convolutional architectures became mainstream. Initial efforts in semantic segmentation utilized models like U-Net, which employs an encoder-decoder architecture for pixel-wise classification, proving effective in segmenting fruit regions from foliage with Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics above 0.80~\cite{ronneberger2015u}. DL progress has since introduced transformer-based models, such as SegFormer, which leverage self-attention mechanisms for better handling of irregular shapes and textures in tropical fruits~\cite{xie2021segformer}. 
%Peng et al.~\cite{peng2018general} improved the SSD model by integrating ResNet-101 with the SSD framework to detect multiple fruit types in open environments. This adaptation resulted in high detection accuracy and efficiency, with an average accuracy of 89.53\% and an F1-score of 96.12\%. 
Barth et al.~\cite{barth2018data} contributed a synthetic dataset approach for semantic segmentation of Capsicum annuum using procedurally modeled imagery, demonstrating significant gains in data augmentation and model generalizability.
%Lin et al.~\cite{lin2019guava} and 
Lin et al.~\cite{lin2020color} advanced the field by using low-cost RGB-D sensors and fully convolutional networks (FCN) for guava detection and 3D pose estimation. These systems delivered high accuracy in fruit segmentation and localization with rapid processing, supporting practical implementation in resource-constrained environments.

More recent research has shifted towards multi-task and semantic segmentation architectures for robust perception in unstructured orchard environments. Kang and Chen~\cite{kang2019fruit, kang2020fruit} introduced the DaSNet and DaSNet-v2 models, employing ResNet backbones and Gated Feature Pyramid Networks for simultaneous detection and semantic segmentation of fruits and branches. Their systems got really good marks in the F1 category and demonstrated ability to handle complex orchard scenes, providing 3D environmental visualizations critical for autonomous navigation and harvesting. Majeed et al.~\cite{majeed2020deep} applied the SegNet architecture for semantic segmentation of apple tree canopies, facilitating tasks such as trunk, branch, and trellis identification to automate orchard management and training processes.
For specific crop types, 
%Birrell et al.~\cite{birrell2020field} presented Vegebot, a robotic harvester for iceberg lettuce, integrating advanced vision with robotic manipulation to achieve a 91\% localization rate in field conditions. 
Luo et al.~\cite{luo2018vision} developed a vision-based methodology that accurately detects cutting points on grape peduncles, overcoming the occlusion and variability of vineyards, rendering an average accuracy of 88.33\%.
Semantic segmentation with models such as DeepLabV3 and U-Net further refined perception capabilities in agricultural robotics applications, establishing sophisticated pixel-level classification approaches that enable precise fruit boundary delineation. Li et al.~\cite{li2020detection, li2021novel} extended semantic segmentation methodologies for litchi and green apple detection through innovative integration of RGB-D data with ensemble U-Net models, incorporating edge structures and gated convolutions to achieve exceptional accuracy in complex, real-world orchard environments where traditional approaches often fail. Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard~\cite{rahnemoonfar2017deep} introduced breakthrough innovations with "Deep Count", a synthetic data-driven fruit counting network that achieved 91\% accuracy while demonstrating the transformative value of artificial datasets in overcoming ground truth limitations that traditionally constrain agricultural robotics development. The systematic combination of advanced segmentation techniques with contemporary detection algorithms has significantly improved system robustness, creating integrated perception pipelines capable of handling the full spectrum of agricultural environment complexities. 
%Luo et al.~\cite{luo2016robust} combined AdaBoost and color component analysis for resilient grape detection in unstructured settings. 
Kirk et al.~\cite{kirk2020b} integrated bio-inspired features and the CIELab color space into a RetinaNet model to enhance strawberry detection under variable lighting, obtaining superior F1-scores compared to traditional approaches. 
%Peng et al.\cite{peng2018general} and 
Feng et al.~\cite{feng2018} demonstrated that integrating classic image processing (edge detection, color segmentation) with DL yields high accuracy for challenging targets such as cherry tomato bunches.

In fruit-picking robotics, these techniques facilitate advanced tasks like ripeness estimation through color-based segmentation, reducing harvest errors by up to 25\%. By complementing R-CNN's instance focus and YOLO's speed, segmentation methods provide a holistic perception layer, crucial for end-to-end system integration in unstructured agricultural settings. 
The ongoing evolution from rule-based methods to advanced deep segmentation networks—with domain adaptation, multi-task learning, and synthetic data augmentation—has markedly advanced the accuracy, efficiency, and autonomy of robotic fruit detection and harvesting systems, addressing primary challenges in real-world environments.

\subsection{Core Performances Metrics of Fruit-Picking}
%The core performance metrics essential for the practical deployment of fruit-picking robots focus on precision, reliability, and scalability deployment, addressing key challenges such as accurate pick-point detection, robust handling of environmental variability, and efficient real-time operations. Figure \ref{fig:performance} provides a structured triangular framework illustrating these interconnected pillars, with clarified metrics to highlight their role in optimizing autonomous harvesting systems.

Practical fruit-picking robots need to shine across three key areas: precision, reliability, and rapidity for scalable use. They zero in on real headaches, from nailing exact grasp spots to rolling with weather changes and keeping things zippy. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:performance}'s triangular framework, 
let's start with precision: think super-accurate pick-points with less than 2 cm error to dodge bruising ~\cite{lehnert2016sweet}), or spotting stems with over 90\% recall so the robot doesn't yank the wrong way~\cite{mendes2016vine}). Add in detection precision—aiming for AUC above 0.71 to catch fruits in tricky light ~\cite{sa2017peduncle}—and you've got a system that rarely misses the mark.
 On the reliability front, it's all about judging ripeness with better than 94\% accuracy via color tweaks~\cite{goel2015fuzzy} plus mapping fruit contours at mAP over 0.80 even when leaves get in the way \cite{lin2019guava}), crucial for not squishing produce in dense canopies. 
Then there's rapidity: we're talking pick cycles under 7 seconds per fruit to match human pace~\cite{kang2020real}), solid yield forecasts with $R^2$ opping 0.75 for smarter planning~\cite{underwood2016mapping}), and quick counting at over 30 FPS with under 2\% error to scan whole rows fast  ~\cite{kang2020fast}). In orchard trials I've reviewed, nailing these speeds can double daily output—what a game-changer for labor-strapped growers!
%Figure \ref{fig:performance} depicts the core performances of fruit-picking systems through three primary pillars: Precision, Reliability, and Rapidity for scalability deployment. Under Precision, metrics include pick-point detection (accuracy in identifying optimal grasping or cutting points, often evaluated by localization error in centimeters, targeting <2 cm for non-destructive harvesting~\cite{lehnert2016sweet}), stem/peduncle/branch localization (recall rates >90\% to minimize crop damage~\cite{mendes2016vine}), and overall detection precision (measured by precision-recall AUC >0.71~\cite{sa2017peduncle}). 
%The Reliability pillar encompasses morphological characteristics such as color analysis (ripeness classification accuracy >94.29\% via hue-saturation metrics~\cite{goel2015fuzzy}), contour detection (mAP >0.80 for edge sharpness in occluded scenes \cite{lin2019guava}), ripeness evaluation (binary or multi-stage accuracy >94\% \cite{liu2019mature}). 
%For Rapidity, key metrics are pick time (average <7 seconds per fruit for high-throughput operations~\cite{kang2020real}), yield estimation (predictive $R^2$ >0.75 for crop forecasting~\cite{underwood2016mapping}), and real-time counting (FPS >30 with counting error <2\% \cite{kang2020fast}). 
%This framework clarifies how these quantifiable indicators drive progress in overcoming challenges like illumination variability, occlusion, and computational efficiency.

Researchers have proposed various solutions to address these metrics, particularly in fruit picking-point detection, which involves identifying attachment points for damage-free harvesting. Algorithms often integrate image segmentation (separating plant parts by color, texture, or depth), edge detection (outlining boundaries for precise localization), geometric and morphological analysis (detecting stem-like structures via shape features), and ML models (e.g., CNNs trained on labeled datasets for prediction accuracy >90\%~\cite{mendes2016vine}).
For instance, in vineyard applications, Mendes et al.~\cite{mendes2016vine} developed ViTruDe for vine trunk and mast identification, employing Sobel keypoints, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors, and SVM classification to reach >95\% accuracy, supporting Precision metrics in  Global Positioning System (GPS)-unreliable environments.

\section{Advances in Motion Control for Fruit-Picking Robotics}
Motion control is a central pillar of fruit-picking robots, essential for ensuring precise and efficient operations in complex agricultural environments. Researchers have developed various advanced algorithms to address the challenges of path planning, obstacle avoidance, and adaptive motion control~\cite{Ahmad:2023_bnb, Loganathan:2024_hho_avoa, Teo:2020, Arrouch:2022b, 10746490}.

\subsection{Algorithmic Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance in Robotic Fruit Harvesting}
%Path planning is crucial for enabling autonomous robots to navigate smoothly while avoiding obstacles
%Path planning, a crucial element in the smooth navigation of autonomous robots while avoiding obstacles, is of paramount importance in the field of robotics
%~\cite {Leong:2024_review}. Key algorithms in this area include A-star (A*) Algorithm, RRT, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and advanced DDPG algorithm~\cite{Loganathan:2023_amr}.
% and  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.
Path planning for autonomous fruit-harvesting systems requires the generation of optimal, collision-free trajectories from the robot's current configuration to target fruit locations while navigating complex agricultural environments~\cite{Leong:2024_review}. Effective path planning algorithms must address the challenges of dynamic obstacle avoidance, environmental uncertainties, and real-time computational constraints inherent in unstructured orchard settings. Classical algorithms such as A* and RRT provide foundational approaches, while modern machine learning-based methods enhance adaptability and robustness for dynamic agricultural scenarios.
%~\cite{Loganathan:2023_amr}.

The A* algorithm, known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path from a start node to a target node while avoiding obstacles, is a reliable choice for grid-based environments. It combines uniform-cost and greedy best-first search features by using a heuristic to estimate the cost from a node to the goal. The primary equation for A* is:
\begin{equation}
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
\label{eq:astar}
\end{equation}

Where:
$f(n)$ is the total cost of the node, 
$g(n)$ is the cost from the start node to $n$, 
$h(n)$ is a heuristic that estimates the cost from $n$ to the goal.

In contrast to grid-based methods like A*, probabilistic approaches such as bi-directional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Bi-RRT) excel in dynamic environments. The Bi-RRT variant, known for its efficiency in navigating dense obstacle environments, is particularly relevant for applications in agricultural settings like sweet pepper harvesting~\cite {bac2016analysis}. The bi-directional version works simultaneously from both the start and the goal, enhancing its efficiency. 
The Bi-RRT algorithm is a popular path planning algorithm used in robotics to efficiently navigate high-dimensional spaces. It operates by simultaneously growing two trees, one from the start position and another from the goal position until they meet to form a complete path.
The RRT algorithm is designed to explore large, high-dimensional spaces quickly by expanding nodes randomly, ensuring coverage of the search space~\cite{lavalle1998rapidly}.
By growing trees from both the start and goal positions, Bi-RRT can find paths more quickly and efficiently than single-tree RRT, especially in complex environments with many obstacles.
After finding a collision-free path, the Bi-RRT algorithm often includes a path-smoothing step to refine the trajectory, making it more suitable for practical use in robotic applications.
%Relevance to Robotic Harvesting:
In the context of sweet-pepper harvesting, the Bi-RRT algorithm stands out for its adaptability to the dynamic and unstructured nature of agricultural environments. It efficiently navigates through dense foliage and obstacles typical in greenhouse settings, finding feasible paths for the robotic manipulator. The bidirectional approach reduces the time needed to find a valid path, enhancing the overall efficiency of the harvesting process.
The fundamental step involves:

%\subsection*{1. Distance Metric}
The distance metric \( d \) is used to find the nearest node in the tree to a given point \( x \):
\begin{equation}
d(x_1, x_2) = \| x_1 - x_2 \|
\end{equation}
where \( \| \cdot \| \) denotes the Euclidean distance.

%\subsection*{2. Node Expansion}
A new node \( x_{\text{new}} \) is generated by moving from the nearest node \( x_{\text{nearest}} \) towards the random sample \( x_{\text{rand}} \) by a step size \( \epsilon \):
\begin{equation}
x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{nearest}} + \epsilon \frac{x_{\text{rand}} - x_{\text{nearest}}}{\| x_{\text{rand}} - x_{\text{nearest}} \|}
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{3. Collision Check}
The path between \( x_{\text{nearest}} \) and \( x_{\text{new}} \) must be checked for collisions with obstacles. This is typically done using a collision detection function \( \text{isCollisionFree}(x_{\text{nearest}}, x_{\text{new}}) \):
\begin{equation}
\text{isCollisionFree}(x_{\text{nearest}}, x_{\text{new}})
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{4. Tree Growing}
The tree is grown by adding the new node \( x_{\text{new}} \) if it is collision-free:
\begin{equation}
\text{Tree} \leftarrow \text{Tree} \cup \{x_{\text{new}}\}
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{5. Path Smoothing}
After a path is found, it can be smoothed by checking and directly connecting non-adjacent nodes on the path, removing intermediate nodes if the direct connection is collision-free:
\begin{equation}
\text{isCollisionFree}(x_i, x_j) \quad \text{for} \quad x_i, x_j \in \text{Path}
\end{equation}

Dijkstra's Algorithm is commonly used in structured environments like orchards or greenhouses where the layout allows for fixed route planning~\cite{silwal2017design, dijkstra1959note}. It is used to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. The update step in Dijkstra's algorithm is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{for each } v \text{ adjacent to } u: \\
\text{if } \text{dist}[u] + \text{length}(u, v) < \text{dist}[v] \\
\text{then } \text{dist}[v] = \text{dist}[u] + \text{length}(u, v)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:dijkstra}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the node currently being considered, $v$ is a node adjacent to $u$, $dist[]$ stores the shortest distance from the source to each vertex, $length(u,v)$ is the edge weight between $u$ and $v$.

Collision avoidance is integral to robotic operations, ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. Algorithms like Vector Field Histogram (VFH), Dynamic-Window Approach (DWA), and Artificial Potential Fields are designed to guide the robot around obstacles, providing a secure operating environment. 
VFH utilizes a polar histogram grid as a statistical representation of the surroundings, calculating the best direction to move without colliding with any obstacles \cite{silwal2017design}. The key equation for VFH is~\cite{borenstein1991vfh}:
\begin{equation}
m(i) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \sum_{j=-k}^k h(i+j) > T \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\label{eq:vfh}
\end{equation}
Where $m(i)$ is the masked polar histogram indicating the presence of an obstacle in the direction $i$,
$h(i)$ is the original polar histogram value at direction $i$, $k$ is the smoothing parameter, $T$ is the threshold determining obstacle presence.

DWA algorithm considers the robot's velocity and heading to predict a set of reachable velocities that avoid collisions~\cite{sepulveda2020robotic}.   The velocity command $(v,\omega)$ is selected by the following optimization~\cite{fox1997dynamic}:
\begin{equation}
(v^*, \omega^*) = \arg \max_{(v, \omega) \in V_s} [ \alpha \cdot \text{heading}(v, \omega) + \beta \cdot \text{dist}(v, \omega) + \gamma \cdot \text{vel}(v, \omega) ]
\label{eq:dwa}
\end{equation}
Where $V_s$ is the set of admissible velocities considering robot dynamics and collision avoidance, $heading(v, \omega)$, $dist(v, \omega)$, and $vel(v, \omega)$ are the cost functions for heading towards the target, distance to the closest obstacle, and forward velocity, respectively. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are the weights for each cost function.

Artificial potential fields are utilized in various robotic applications, including those in the agricultural sector, to guide robots around obstacles by simulating attractive and repulsive forces~\cite{ling2019dual}. The equation for the Artificial Potential Fields method
\begin{equation}
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{attr}} + U_{\text{rep}}
\label{eq:potentialfields}
\end{equation}
where $U_{total}$ is the total potential field, $U_{attr}$ is the attractive potential towards the goal. $U_{rep}$ is the repulsive potential from obstacles.

Innovations in motion control focus on adaptability and efficiency. Recent developments focus on integrating these established algorithms with new, innovative approaches like learning-based approaches and hybrid systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly combined with traditional path planning algorithms like  DDPG to enhance adaptability and efficiency in dynamic environments, as demonstrated in guava orchards~\cite{lin2021collision}.
The DDPG algorithm is popular for dealing with continuous action spaces, typical in robotics~\cite{lillicrap2015continuous}. It is an actor-critic algorithm that merges ideas from Deep Q-Network (DQN) and deterministic policy gradients, learning policies efficiently in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces.
Integrating different algorithms to leverage their strengths enhances path planning and collision avoidance, as seen in using advanced motion planning algorithms in sweet pepper harvesting~\cite{lehnert2017autonomous}.
% \cite{BioInspiredAlgorithmsReference}.

%DDPG algorithm is increasingly popular in robotic path planning, mainly when dealing with continuous action spaces, which are typical in robotics \cite{lillicrap2015continuous}. DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm that merges ideas from DQN (Deep Q-Network) and deterministic policy gradients. It is well-suited for environments with high-dimensional, continuous action spaces.
DDPG is notable for its ability to learn policies efficiently in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces, making it ideal for robotic applications where precise, continuous control is required. The algorithm consists of two main components: an actor that proposes actions given the current state and a critic that evaluates the action by computing the value function.
DDPG has been successfully applied in various robotic path planning contexts, such as navigating complex environments where traditional algorithms struggle with real-time efficiency and adaptability. For instance, in collision-free path planning, DDPG can optimize a robot's trajectory in a dynamic environment, learning to avoid obstacles while minimizing path length and time.
The critic network updates its weights by minimizing the loss function based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The loss function \( L \) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \left(y_i - Q(s_i, a_i | \theta^Q)\right)^2
\end{equation}
where \( y_i = r_i + \gamma Q'(s_{i+1}, \mu'(s_{i+1} | \theta^{\mu'}) | \theta^{Q'}) \) is the target value, calculated using the target networks, \( Q' \) and \( \mu' \) are the target critic and actor networks, \( \theta^Q \) and \( \theta^{\mu} \) are the parameters of the critic and actor networks, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( N \) is the number of samples.

%\subsection*{Actor Update}
The actor network updates its policy by using the policy gradient:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\theta^\mu} J \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \nabla_a Q(s, a | \theta^Q)|_{s=s_i, a=\mu(s_i)} \nabla_{\theta^\mu} \mu(s | \theta^\mu)|_{s_i}
\end{equation}
This gradient indicates changing the actor's parameters to increase the expected reward.

%\subsection*{Adding Noise for Exploration}
Exploration is essential for effective learning in continuous action spaces. Noise is added to the actor's output:
\begin{equation}
a_t = \mu(s_t|\theta^\mu) + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \text{Noise process}
\end{equation}
where \( \epsilon \) often comes from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, providing temporally correlated exploration beneficial in physical control problems.

\subsection{Advances in Motion Planning and Control for Robotic Fruit Harvesting}
Real-time motion planning for autonomous fruit-picking systems presents significant computational challenges that require algorithmic innovations to achieve sub-millisecond response times while maintaining trajectory optimality. The integration of high-frequency perception data (typically 30-60 Hz) with motion control systems demands efficient algorithms that can process multi-dimensional state spaces and generate collision-free trajectories within strict temporal constraints imposed by real-time agricultural operations.

\textbf{Computational Complexity and Algorithm Performance Analysis}

Motion planning algorithms for agricultural robotics exhibit varying computational complexities that directly impact real-time feasibility. Sampling-based planners demonstrate O(n log n) average-case complexity for path queries, while graph-based methods scale as O(V + E log V) where V represents configuration space vertices and E represents valid transitions. These complexity characteristics become critical when planning frequencies exceed 10 Hz for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Performance benchmarking across different algorithmic families reveals distinct computational profiles. RRT-based planners achieve typical query times of 15-30 milliseconds for 7-DOF systems in agricultural environments, while A* implementations require 5-15 milliseconds for grid-based representations with sufficient resolution. Deep reinforcement learning approaches, once trained, achieve inference times of 1-5 milliseconds but require extensive computational resources during training phases. Recent advances in real-time collision avoidance demonstrate that DRL integration can achieve sub-millisecond response times for agricultural robotic systems while maintaining high success rates .

\textbf{Real-Time Implementation and Hardware Acceleration}

GPU acceleration techniques enable significant speedup for computationally intensive motion planning operations. Parallel sampling strategies for RRT variants achieve 10-50x acceleration through CUDA implementations, while neural network inference for RL-based planners benefits from tensor processing unit (TPU) optimization. Advanced edge computing efficiency techniques demonstrate substantial improvements in real-time implementation for robotics applications, with GPU-based parallel architectures achieving significant energy efficiency gains \cite{9330509}. Edge computing platforms specifically designed for robotics applications provide balanced processing capabilities for integrated perception-planning systems, leveraging optimized algorithms for efficient signal reconstruction and real-time data processing \cite{10518056}.

Memory management strategies become crucial for real-time implementation, particularly when maintaining probabilistic roadmaps or learned value functions. Efficient data structures such as k-d trees for nearest neighbor queries and octrees for collision detection reduce memory footprint while maintaining query performance. These optimizations enable deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems common in agricultural robotics.

\textbf{System Integration and Communication Protocols}

Multi-threaded architectures separate perception, planning, and control processes to maximize computational efficiency and system responsiveness. Asynchronous communication protocols enable perception systems to update environmental models while planning algorithms generate trajectories based on slightly outdated but consistent world representations. Advanced real-time data analysis architectures demonstrate systematic approaches for handling high-frequency data streams while maintaining computational efficiency and system stability \cite{10497583}. This architectural approach maintains system stability while accommodating the computational demands of complex planning algorithms.

Network-based coordination for multi-robot systems requires efficient communication protocols that minimize latency while ensuring coordination safety. Distributed consensus algorithms enable fleet-wide coordination with logarithmic communication complexity, making them scalable for large orchard operations with multiple autonomous harvesters. Graph neural network approaches for distributed motion planning in multi-robot agricultural systems provide novel coordination protocols that significantly improve scalability and efficiency .

Motion planning in autonomous robotic harvesting represents a critical computational challenge that encompasses the systematic determination of optimal trajectories for robotic end-effectors to successfully reach, precisely grasp, and safely sever target fruits while minimizing damage to both harvested products and surrounding vegetation. This complex process requires sophisticated algorithms that simultaneously optimize trajectory efficiency, collision avoidance, energy consumption, and harvesting precision under dynamic environmental conditions.

Our motion planning analysis synthesizes data from 16 primary research studies selected for comprehensive system descriptions and quantitative performance reporting across diverse algorithmic paradigms: classical geometric methods (7 studies), reinforcement learning approaches (3 studies), vision-guided techniques (2 studies), and hybrid systems (4 studies). Performance data spans greenhouse environments (5 studies), structured orchards (4 studies), unstructured conditions (4 studies), and laboratory settings (3 studies). The temporal analysis reveals a significant paradigm shift from traditional geometric methods (dominant 2015-2018) to learning-based approaches (accelerated adoption 2019-2024), driven by breakthrough developments in deep reinforcement learning and vision-guided planning algorithms.

In locomotion technologies, significant progress has been made in path planning and collision avoidance. Autonomous robots equipped with advanced sensors like LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and ultrasonic sensors can generate detailed maps of their surroundings \cite{liu2024hierarchical}. Algorithms such as the A* algorithm, Bi-RRT, and DDPG are increasingly being used to enhance the robots' ability to navigate complex orchard terrains safely and efficiently \cite{gai2022fruit, rajendran2024towards}. Hierarchical trajectory planning allows robots to make informed decisions at different levels of granularity, first planning a high-level path through the orchard and then refining it at a local level to avoid specific obstacles while approaching the target fruit \cite{liu2024hierarchical}.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Trends}
Despite significant technological breakthroughs, autonomous fruit-picking robots continue to face substantial challenges that limit their widespread adoption. Primary obstacles include handling occlusions in dense foliage, adapting to variable lighting conditions, and ensuring robust performance in unstructured agricultural environments \cite{hou2023overview, suresh2023selective}. The high capital costs of these autonomous systems remain a significant barrier for small-scale farmers \cite{zhang2024automatic}. Additionally, the complexity of integrating disparate technologies—combining vision systems with robotic manipulators and ensuring seamless communication in multi-robot harvesting scenarios—presents ongoing technical challenges \cite{li2023multi, rajendran2024towards}.

Future research directions emphasize the integration of advanced AI architectures, including diffusion-based models \cite{heschl2024synthset}, and multi-modal sensor fusion approaches. Promising developments include UAV-ground robot coordination systems that enable predictive path planning and optimize energy efficiency through intelligent task allocation. These integrated approaches are particularly relevant as climate change continues to alter fruit development patterns and orchard conditions, necessitating more adaptive and resilient robotic systems.

To systematically assess the technological maturity and development trajectory of autonomous fruit harvesting systems, we employ Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)—a standardized framework originally developed by NASA and widely adopted in technology assessment. TRL quantifies technology maturity on a scale from 1 (basic principles observed) to 9 (system proven in operational environment), providing objective benchmarks for comparing different technological components and guiding strategic research investments. In agricultural robotics, TRL assessments enable systematic evaluation of component technologies including computer vision systems, motion planning algorithms, multi-robot coordination frameworks, and integrated commercial platforms. Figure~\ref{fig:future_directions_roadmap} presents a extensive examination utilizing TRL assessments of current technology maturity, research priority matrices, innovation timeline projections, and systematic challenge-solution integration strategies for advancing autonomous fruit harvesting toward widespread commercial deployment.

%\subsection{ Future Trends}
%Advanced Deep - Learning - based Perception
Future YOLO-based fruit detection is likely to incorporate more advanced neural architecture search techniques, which will automatically search for the optimal neural network architecture for specific fruit-detection tasks, further improving performance \cite{hou2023overview, suresh2023selective}. Self-supervised learning methods will be increasingly integrated, enabling the models to learn from unlabeled data and reducing the heavy reliance on large, manually-annotated datasets \cite{suresh2023selective, zhang2024automatic}. As a result, fruit-picking robots will be able to adapt more readily to diverse fruit types, sizes, and growth conditions, significantly enhancing the reliability of fruit detection.

%Multi - sensor Fusion for Comprehensive Perception
Multi-sensor fusion will continue to evolve. The integration of hyperspectral and thermal sensors with traditional RGB-D cameras will become more common \cite{mohamed2021smart, martos2021ensuring}. Hyperspectral sensors can provide detailed information about the chemical composition of fruits, allowing for more accurate determination of ripeness and the detection of hidden defects. Thermal sensors can detect temperature variations, which can be related to fruit health and stress levels. New algorithms for dynamic multi - sensor fusion will be developed, which will be able to adaptively select and combine sensor data based on the complexity of the environment \cite{liu2024hierarchical}.

%Autonomous Navigation in Unstructured Environments
Motion planning algorithms will focus more on real-time adaptation. Hierarchical and decentralized path - planning approaches will gain more traction \cite{lytridis2021overview, li2023multi}. In a hierarchical approach, the robot can first plan a broad - scale path through the orchard based on a high-level map and then refine this path at a local level as it encounters specific obstacles or changes in the environment. Decentralized path planning will enable multiple robots to operate independently yet collaboratively, avoiding collisions and optimizing overall harvesting efficiency. ML-based prediction models will be integrated into motion planning, which can analyze past data on environmental changes, such as the movement patterns of wind-blown branches or the typical behavior of animals in the orchard, to anticipate potential obstacles and plan optimal paths in advance \cite{rajendran2024towards}.

%UAV - enabled Monitoring and Harvesting Support
UAVs will play an increasingly important role in fruit harvesting \cite{mohamed2021smart, martos2021ensuring}. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, multispectral sensors, and lightweight LiDAR, UAVs can conduct large-scale orchard monitoring. They can quickly map the entire orchard, providing real-time information on fruit distribution, ripeness levels, and crop health. This data can be used to optimize the deployment of ground-based fruit-picking robots \cite{martos2021ensuring}. Lightweight and energy-efficient UAV designs, combined with advanced flight-control algorithms to ensure stable operation in various weather conditions, will be developed to make this technology more practical and accessible for farmers.

%Scalability and Cost - effectiveness
Scalability and cost-effectiveness will be at the forefront of future development. Modular and reconfigurable robot designs will be introduced, allowing farmers to easily adapt the robots to different fruit-picking tasks and orchard layouts \cite{lytridis2021overview, li2023multi}. The use of open-source hardware and software platforms will also reduce development costs and encourage wider adoption \cite{zhang2024automatic}. Cloud-based services for data storage, processing, and model training will enable small - scale farmers to access advanced technologies without significant upfront investment. Through these efforts, autonomous fruit-harvesting technologies will transition from being experimental to becoming a mainstream and economically viable solution in the agricultural industry, contributing to sustainable and efficient food production.



\section{Conclusion}
This comprehensive survey has systematically analyzed the rapid evolution of autonomous fruit-picking robots, emphasizing critical advances in visual perception, motion control, and perception-action integration. Through methodical examination of 56 studies (2015-2024) following PRISMA guidelines, we have identified significant technological breakthroughs while acknowledging persistent challenges that require sustained research attention.

Key findings reveal that deep learning models, particularly the R-CNN and YOLO series, have substantially enhanced fruit detection capabilities in complex agricultural environments. The evolution from YOLOv8 to YOLO11 has demonstrated remarkable improvements in real-time performance, multi-task capabilities, and adaptation to diverse orchard conditions. Similarly, advances in motion planning algorithms, including hierarchical trajectory planning and reinforcement learning approaches, have enabled more sophisticated navigation and collision avoidance in unstructured environments.

Despite these advances, significant challenges persist, including occlusion handling in dense foliage environments, scalability constraints, and cost-effectiveness barriers that limit adoption, particularly for small-scale agricultural operations. The integration of multi-sensor fusion approaches, UAV-enabled monitoring systems, and collaborative robotic frameworks represents promising directions for addressing these limitations.

Looking forward, the field requires sustained focus on developing affordable, adaptable systems that can reliably operate across diverse agricultural contexts. Priority areas include advancing neural architecture search for task-specific optimization, implementing dynamic fusion algorithms for variable environments, and establishing standardized benchmarks for cross-study comparisons. The ultimate goal remains the development of commercially viable robotic harvesting systems that can enhance productivity while ensuring accessibility across different scales of agricultural operations, from large commercial farms to small-holder farming communities. 

%Robotic fruit picking is advancing toward fully autonomous systems that thrive in varied farm settings. Notwithstanding the persistent challenges posed by occlusion, overcrowded canopies, and scaling costs, the field has witnessed steady advancements in vision and navigation, which hold considerable promise for addressing these issues. In the context of future planning, it is imperative to prioritize the integration of technology that is both affordable and sustainable. This technology should be adaptable to a variety of crops and practices.




%The field of robotic fruit picking is moving towards fully autonomous systems capable of operating in diverse agricultural environments. While significant challenges such as occlusion, dense picking environments, and scalability remain, the continual advancements in vision detection and locomotion technologies are potential. Future research should focus on integrating these technologies into commercially viable solutions, with an emphasis on sustainability and adaptability to different crop types and farming practices. The development of standardized performance metrics and broader collaborative research initiatives could further accelerate the adoption of these technologies in real-world agricultural settings~\cite{lalander2015vermicomposting, mark2019ethics}.
