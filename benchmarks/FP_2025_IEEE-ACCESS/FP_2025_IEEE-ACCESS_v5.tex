\begin{abstract}
This review provides exhaustive quantitative benchmarking of visual perception and motion control algorithms for autonomous fruit-picking robots, analyzing 56 studies published between 2015 and 2024. We deliver experimental validation of algorithm family performance characteristics, including R-CNN, YOLO, hybrid approaches, and traditional methods across diverse agricultural environments. Statistical examination reveals significant performance hierarchies with YOLO algorithms achieving optimal balance (90.9\% accuracy, 84ms processing) for real-time commercial deployment, while R-CNN approaches provide superior precision (90.7\% accuracy) for quality-critical applications. Motion planning evaluation reveals success rates ranging from 58-92\% across different algorithmic approaches, with DDPG and reinforcement learning showing enhanced adaptability for unstructured environments. Despite technological advances, persistent challenges remain in multi-sensor fusion, cost-effective scalability, and delicate fruit handling for commercial agricultural adoption.

\section{Introduction}
Agricultural systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges including persistent labor shortages, escalating operational costs, and increasing demands for sustainable harvesting methodologies. Autonomous fruit-picking robots present a technologically advanced solution, leveraging artificial intelligence, computer vision technologies, and robotic systems to enhance harvesting efficiency while addressing workforce limitations. This thorough review methodically examines the current technological readiness and performance capabilities of autonomous fruit-picking systems relative to human harvesting benchmarks.

Recent technological breakthroughs in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and multi-sensor fusion have significantly enhanced robotic systems' capabilities for object detection, localization, and precise manipulation. These developments have been systematically reviewed and summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:survey_summary}, demonstrating substantial progress in addressing traditional limitations in end-to-end system integration.
%The advent of autonomous fruit-picking robots signifies a substantial advancement in agricultural technology, precipitated by the necessity to address labor shortages, escalating costs, and the demand for enhanced efficiency in fruit production.
%Rapid advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have catalyzed substantial interest in developing fruit-picking robots. These robots promise to revolutionize agricultural practices by automating labor-intensive fruit harvesting. Fruit-picking robots are autonomous systems engineered to identify, locate, and harvest fruits from various trees and plants. 
%These systems leverage advanced technologies, including computer vision, machine learning (ML), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT), to operate efficiently in diverse agricultural environments, handle fruits delicately, and complement human labor.
%These systems leverage a suite of advanced technologies, including computer vision, machine learning (ML), robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT). The aim is to create robots that can operate efficiently in various agricultural environments, handle fruits delicately to avoid damage, and work alongside human labor to enhance productivity. 
%like Figure~\ref{fig:fruit_picking_robot_overview}.
%Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) and sensor fusion have facilitated the development of sophisticated perception and motion control mechanisms, enabling robots to detect, localize, and harvest fruits with increasing precision.
 Figure ~\ref{fig:struct} illustrates the general architecture of an autonomous fruit-picking robot, highlighting key components such as visual sensors for detection, manipulator arms for grasping, and navigation systems for mobility. This advancement has been particularly evident in addressing challenges such as occlusion, variable lighting, and unstructured orchards.

Existing literature reviews have laid the groundwork for understanding strides in autonomous fruit-picking technologies as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:survey_summary}. These recent surveys, all published since 2021, have collectively advanced the field by addressing various aspects of robotic systems, though they often exhibit limitations in scope and integration.
For instance, Hou et al. \cite{hou2023overview} focused on the integration of deep learning (DL) with multi-sensor vision systems, emphasizing perception sensors and machine vision to enhance fruit detection in unstructured environments. While this work provided valuable insights into AI-driven fusion and trends in field robustness, it overlooked broader system integration and actuation mechanisms. Similarly, Navas et al. \cite{navas2021soft} specialized in soft and bionic gripper designs, advancing understanding of adaptive handling for delicate fruits from a mechanical perspective, but neglected upstream components like perception or downstream integration, resulting in a siloed approach.
In contrast, more extensive reviews such as those by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024automatic} and Mingyou et al. \cite{mingyou2024orchard} adopted end-to-end perspectives. Zhang et al. covered machine vision, motion planning, end-effectors, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation, notably including real-time control via IoT/5G and economic feasibility assessments for practical deployment. Mingyou et al. extended this by addressing multi-robot coordination and large-scale perception in expansive orchard settings, innovating with robust mapping and cooperative robotics trends. These works excelled in promoting holistic views but were sometimes constrained by their emphasis on specific deployment scenarios, such as large-scale orchards, potentially limiting applicability to smaller or diverse crop types.
Other surveys, including Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2022intelligent} and Rajendran et al. \cite{rajendran2024towards}, emphasized modular architectures and precision control. Zhou et al. explored machine vision, motion planning, and field adaptation, highlighting vision-driven precision and scalable designs for orchard autonomy, though without delving into mechanical details or cooperative elements. Rajendran et al. integrated perception sensors, machine vision, end-effectors, and field adaptation to discuss dexterous control and selective harvesting synergies, improving real-field reliability, yet their scope was somewhat narrow, focusing on targeted operations without broader multi-crop generalizations. Collectively, these surveys advanced the field by identifying key performance indicators, such as detection accuracy and adaptability metrics, but their fragmentation—often isolating components like perception from action or constraining to specific fruits (e.g., apples or citrus)—left gaps in fully end-to-end frameworks that encompass diverse agricultural contexts.
%This section reviews the primary contributions of some key surveys, highlighting their scopes and insights, followed by a discussion of their collective limitations, which motivate the innovations in this paper.
%Hou et al. \cite{hou2023overview}  focused on the integration of deep learning (DL) with multi-sensor vision systems. Their survey emphasized perception sensors and machine vision, detailing how AI-driven fusion enhances fruit detection in unstructured environments. This work highlighted trends in field robustness but overlooked broader system integration and actuation mechanisms.
%Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2024automatic}  provided an end-to-end perspective on automation chains, covering machine vision, motion planning, end-effectors, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation. A notable contribution was the inclusion of real-time control via IoT/5G and economic feasibility assessments, offering a holistic view of practical deployment.
%Navas et al. \cite{navas2021soft} specialized in soft and bionic gripper designs, concentrating exclusively on end-effecters. Their analysis advanced understanding of adaptive handling for delicate fruits, drawing from mechanical perspectives, though it neglected upstream components like perception or downstream integration.
%Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2022intelligent} explored modular architectures, with emphasis on machine vision, motion planning, and field adaptation. Key insights included vision-driven precision and robot autonomy in orchards, promoting scalable designs that enhance adaptability without delving into mechanical details or cooperative elements.
%Mingyou et al. \cite{mingyou2024orchard}  addressed multi-robot coordination and large-scale perception, covering machine vision, motion planning, mechanical automation, system integration, and field adaptation. This survey innovated by focusing on robust mapping and execution in expansive orchard settings, incorporating cooperative robotics trends.
%Rajendran et al. \cite{rajendran2024towards} integrated perception sensors, machine vision, end-effectors, and field adaptation to discuss precision and dexterous control. Their contribution centered on selective harvesting synergies, improving real-field reliability for targeted operations.

%While these surveys collectively advance the discourse on fruit-picking robotics, several limitations persist that hinder a fully integrated and forward-looking understanding of the field. First, many exhibit a narrow temporal scope or outdated coverage; 
%While prior surveys have advanced the field as summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:survey_summary}, they exhibit limitations that our work addresses. 
%For instance, many have a narrow temporal scope, focusing predominantly on literature before 2020 and overlooking recent breakthroughs in DL models like YOLOv8.
% Zhou et al. and Navas et al. end in 2021, missing pivotal post-2022 developments in AI and multimodal sensing. Hou et al. and Rajendran et al. extend to 2022-2023 but underexplore emerging trends like unified benchmarking or cost-feasibility analyses, which are critical for industrial translation.
%A deeper issue is the siloed focus on specific subsystems: Navas et al. isolates end-effectors without linking to perception-action loops, while Hou et al. prioritizes vision but ignores motion planning and mechanical automation. This fragmentation leads to incomplete end-to-end frameworks, as seen in the absence of system integration in several works (e.g., Hou, Navas, Zhou, and Rajendran). Moreover, cooperative robotics and benchmarking are inconsistently addressed. Mingyou et al. touches on multi-robot aspects, but others largely omit them, resulting in a lack of standardized evaluation metrics for cross-study comparisons. Zhang et al. makes strides in economic feasibility, yet this is not uniformly integrated across surveys, often overlooking practical barriers like deployment costs and scalability in diverse agricultural contexts.
% Additionally, several adopt a siloed approach, emphasizing isolated aspects such as detection or grasping without integrating them into a cohesive end-to-end framework. This fragmentation underscores gaps in holistic analyses, which we bridge through a 'perception-action' approach that encompasses multi-sensor fusion, visual perception, and motion control.
%These limitations collectively underscore a gap in synthesizing multimodal fusion, perception-action integration, and roadmap-oriented guidance for future research. Without addressing these, the field risks redundant efforts and delayed real-world adoption.

The survey under discussion addresses the limitations of prior works, including fragmented subsystem analyses, insufficient end-to-end integration, and the absence of unified benchmarking and scalability considerations. It does so by introducing a holistic "perception-action" framework.
We critically evaluate technological breakthroughs, identify persistent challenges, and propose future directions to accelerate commercial adoption.
%Drawing from the foundational insights of surveys like Hou et al. on deep learning fusion, Zhang et al. on complete automation chains, and Mingyou et al. on multi-robot coordination, this paper emphasizes synergistic integrations that bridge gaps in real-world applicability. 
%Specifically, it focuses on: (1) multi-modal sensor fusion (integrating IoT, remote sensing, and vision \cite{mohamed2021smart,martos2021ensuring,liu2024hierarchical}) with advanced DL models (e.g., evolved YOLO architectures) to overcome detection fragility in dynamic environments, extending beyond the vision-centric approaches in Hou et al. and Rajendran et al.; (2) linking visual perception outputs (e.g., fruit stem localization \cite{li2023mta}) with adaptive path planning (e.g., LiDAR-fused trajectory optimization \cite{liu2024hierarchical}) for seamless operations in unstructured terrain, addressing siloed motion planning in Zhou et al. and Mingyou et al.; and (3) incorporating collaborative robotics principles \cite{lytridis2021overview,li2023multi} alongside system-level efficiency and cost-feasibility analyses to tackle scalability challenges overlooked in component-focused reviews like Navas et al.

The core contributions of this survey are thus:
\begin{itemize}

\end{figure}

%Following PRISMA guidelines, our process began with database searches
We systematically searched databases including Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and ScienceDirect using keywords and phrases detailed in Table~\ref{tab:keywords}. The search strategy employed combined terms such as "autonomous fruit picking," "robotic harvesting," and "deep learning in orchard" to capture a comprehensive range of studies published between 2015 and 2024. This initial search yielded 3,430 records after removing duplicates.

%We began our research by systematically searching three well-established scientific databases, Web of Science (WoS), ScienceDirect and Scopus, to assemble a comprehensive collection of publications related to autonomous fruit-picking robots. The keywords used for these searches are listed in Table~\ref{tab:keywords}. The search was limited to English-language articles published between 2015 and 2024. This process resulted in 2358 records from WoS, 536 from ScienceDirect and 2030 from Scopus, as well in 100 from Google Scholar and Connected Papers, for a combined total of 4924 records prior to screening. To further ensure the completeness of our dataset, we also performed supplementary searches via Google Scholar and the Connected Papers , yielding an additional 76 and 24 records, respectively. In total, 5024 publications were identified in this initial phase.

%Of the 5024 records initially identified, a comprehensive screening process was conducted to ensure the quality and relevance of the included studies. First, duplicates were identified and removed, resulting in 3430 unique entries. Manual screening was then performed without the aid of automation tools. During the title screening phase, 3018 records were excluded based on apparent irrelevance to the review topic. The remaining studies underwent abstract screening, which further reduced the collection to 412 potentially relevant records. Finally, full-text reviews were conducted on these entries to assess their fit with the review criteria.

Subsequent screening applied predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to refine the selection. Inclusion criteria encompassed:

(1)Records describing advancements in perception, motion control, or end-to-end systems for fruit-picking robots;

(2)Studies published in peer-reviewed journals or conferences between 2015 and 2024;

(3)Works providing empirical evaluations or novel methodologies in agricultural robotics.

Exclusion criteria included:

(1)Non-English publications;

(2)Records focused solely on non-fruit crops or unrelated agricultural tasks;

(3)Grey literature without rigorous peer review.

After title and abstract screening, 412 records advanced to full-text review, resulting in 137 studies selected for in-depth analysis as detailed in Figure \ref{fig:prisma1}. This rigorous selection process enabled us to identify the most impactful research, spanning from laboratory prototypes to field validation trials. 

%The inclusion criteria for this review were as follows: (i) records describing fruit picking methods involving visual detection and segmentation; (ii) records focused on robot motion control applications such as path planning and collision avoidance; (iii) explicit statements regarding the motivation behind agricultural robot harvest; (iv) Records focused on the development, application, and evaluation of harvesting robots; (v) publications in the form of journal articles or conference proceedings; and (vi) empirical research based on experimental results rather than purely simulation-based studies.

%Papers were excluded if they: (i) did not meet the above inclusion criteria; (ii) were review articles, surveys, or book chapters; (iii) lacked a clearly articulated motivation for agriculture robot; (iv) relied solely on simulation without experimental validation; or (v) were unavailable or inaccessible in full text.

%Figure~\ref{fig:camera}, these combined methodologies enable more exhaustive and accurate perception, greatly enhancing fruit detection and localization even in challenging agricultural conditions.

Modern fruit-picking operations are increasingly reliant on precise measurements of plant morphology and depth. Plant morphology encompasses features such as color, shape, edge, 	3D contour, texture, and ripeness of fruits, leaves, peduncle and stems under varying illumination, occlusion, and dynamic conditions—characteristics primarily captured by various visual sensors. For depth characterization of observed targets, distance sensors are additionally required. 
Consequently, fruit-picking robots rely on multi-sensor fusion (as illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:camera}) to acquire diverse features, thereby reducing measurement errors and enhancing robustness.
%Consequently, fruit-picking robots inevitably depend on multi-sensor fusion to acquire these diverse features, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:camera}. Furthermore, the synergy among different modalities effectively reduces measurement range errors, enhances robustness, adaptability, and precision under illumination variations and occlusion, shortens picking time, and improves real-time performance.

Among multi-sensor approaches, 3D stereo vision systems are essential by using dual cameras to estimate depth via triangulation, effectively mimicking human binocular vision. Early efforts include Wang et al.~\cite{wang2016localisation}, who developed a binocular stereo vision system for litchi localization, incorporating wavelet transforms and clustering methods to obtain high accuracy under natural lighting. Similarly, Si et al.~\cite{si2015location} advanced apple detection by enabling their stereo vision platform to recognize and localize multiple fruits simultaneously in variable environments. Luo et al.~\cite{luo2016vision} further demonstrated a grape-harvesting stereo system capable of quickly detecting cutting points and estimating yields with high efficiency.
RGB-D cameras which combine color information with depth sensing using time-of-flight or structured light have also proven highly beneficial. Barnea et al.~\cite{barnea2016colour} presented an RGB-D-based 3D detection method capable of analyzing both shape and symmetry, which is effective for sweet pepper harvesting even under complex conditions. Nguyen et al.~\cite{nguyen2016detection} showed that integrating depth with RGB data significantly improves apple detection and localization, especially under occlusion. Kusumam et al.~\cite{kusumam20173d} and Andújar et al.~\cite{andujar2016using} extended these principles to broccoli and cauliflower, using mobile RGB-D platforms to deliver precise 3D crop measurements crucial for automated harvest scheduling.
Sensor fusion extends beyond vision alone: for example, Gongal et al.~\cite{gongal2018apple} used a combination of color and time-of-flight 3D cameras to estimate apple size, demonstrating higher accuracy using pixel size information—an important step forward for volume estimation and crop management.
The integration of visual sensors with advanced algorithms—such as DL models and inverse kinematics—further automates and optimizes fruit detection and harvesting. Onishi et al.~\cite{onishi2019automated} combined a stereo camera with an SSD DL model to gain high real-time detection accuracy, precisely guiding the robot's arm through calculated movements.

%Multi-modality data fusion plays a critical role in advancing agricultural robotics by enhancing perception accuracy and operational efficiency. 
While multi-sensor systems, such as 3D stereo vision setups, have significantly advanced agricultural robotics by capturing richer environmental data, their effectiveness remains constrained when relying solely on homogeneous sensor inputs (e.g., visual data from dual cameras). To address this limitation, multi-modality data fusion has emerged as a logical next step, extending beyond the integration of similar sensors to combine fundamentally different types of data. This approach leverages the unique strengths of diverse modalities including visual, spectral, IoT-derived etc. to create a more comprehensive and robust perceptual framework.
For example, Horng et al.~\cite{horng2019smart} developed a crop harvesting system that integrates image recognition with IoT technology. By combining MobileNetV2 and SSD, the system can assess crop maturity with an average precision of 84\% and coordinate the movement of multiaxial robotic arms. This integrated solution automates and optimizes harvesting procedures, leading to increased efficiency and a reduction in labor-intensive tasks.
LiDAR-based data fusion has also shown considerable promise in orchard-scale mapping and monitoring. Underwood et al.~\cite{underwood2016mapping} demonstrated the integration of LiDAR and vision sensors on a mobile robotic platform for almond orchard mapping. This approach enables dynamic 3D mapping of canopy volumes, as well as the capture of data on flower and fruit densities, facilitating automated and season-spanning monitoring. The system revealed a strong predictive correlation between sensor-derived canopy volumes and actual yields, establishing a benchmark for subsequent developments in field robotics.
Further highlighting the advantages of LiDAR technology, Gené-Mola et al.~\cite{gene2019fruit} utilized a mobile terrestrial laser scanner equipped with a Velodyne VLP-16 to detect and localize Fuji apples by analyzing reflectance at 905 nm. The method yielded a localization success rate of 87.5\%, an identification success rate of 82.4\%, and an F1-score of 0.858, demonstrating robust performance under various lighting conditions and precise three-dimensional fruit localization. Koenig et al.~\cite{koenig2015comparative} conducted a comparative analysis of post-harvest growth detection using terrestrial LiDAR point clouds, obtaining 99\% precision with 0.0\% error. Their work underscores the effectiveness of combining geometric and radiometric features and illustrates the utility of LiDAR in weed management for precision agriculture.

As comprehensively documented in Table~\ref{tab:dataset}, multi-modality synergy represents a transformative advancement in robotic fruit-picking capabilities by integrating diverse sensor technologies to overcome individual modality limitations. The methodical examination reveals how combining RGB sensing with depth perception, spatial calibration systems, and environmental monitoring creates robust perception frameworks that significantly enhance detection accuracy, localization precision, and operational reliability. These multi-sensor fusion approaches demonstrate measurable improvements in challenging agricultural conditions, including variable illumination (achieving 97.9\% performance in cloudy conditions and 89.5\% in backlight scenarios), complex occlusion patterns (maintaining 94\% matching rates for partially occluded fruits), and diverse environmental contexts ranging from structured greenhouse settings to unstructured commercial orchards. However, the technological complexity introduces specific constraints including increased processing requirements (ranging from 0.7s to 197s per image depending on approach), hardware cost considerations, and calibration dependencies that must be carefully evaluated when designing practical deployment strategies for diverse agricultural applications.

R-CNN family approaches demonstrate consistent precision advantages across fruit-picking applications, with accuracy ranging from 84.8\% (Sa et al. 2016) to 90.7\% (Wan et al. 2020), though processing times remain higher than YOLO alternatives (58-393ms vs 71-95ms). Detailed performance metrics and statistical evidence are provided in Table~\ref{tab:literature_support_summary}.

\subsection{Experimental Validation and Quantitative Performance Benchmarks}
Figure~\ref{fig:meta_analysis_ieee} presents a comprehensive experimental validation framework that systematically analyzes algorithm performance across diverse agricultural deployment scenarios, providing critical insights into the technological landscape of autonomous fruit-picking systems. The detailed quantitative analysis illuminates how different algorithm families have evolved through distinct optimization pathways to serve specialized operational requirements, with each family developing unique architectural characteristics that reflect fundamental engineering trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational efficiency, and environmental robustness. This systematic evaluation framework enables practitioners to understand performance boundaries, identify optimal deployment contexts, and make evidence-based decisions for specific agricultural applications while considering constraints such as hardware limitations, processing requirements, and environmental variability encountered in real-world orchard and greenhouse settings.

The experimental evidence confirms that algorithm family selection significantly impacts deployment success across different agricultural contexts. YOLO algorithms achieve exceptional performance optimization through end-to-end architecture design, delivering 90.9\% detection accuracy with 84ms processing latency that enables real-time autonomous operations in commercial harvesting scenarios. This performance breakthrough addresses critical deployment barriers that previously limited autonomous agricultural systems to controlled environments.

R-CNN approaches demonstrate alternative optimization strategies focused on detection precision rather than processing speed. These methods achieve 90.7\% accuracy through multi-stage processing architectures that require 226ms computational cycles. While this latency constrains real-time applications, the precision advantage proves valuable for quality-critical operations where detection errors carry significant economic consequences. Hybrid approaches bridge traditional computer vision robustness with modern deep learning capabilities, achieving balanced performance that adapts effectively to variable environmental conditions encountered in diverse agricultural settings.

Table~\ref{tab:ieee_meta_summary} consolidates these comprehensive experimental findings into quantitative benchmarks that provide critical insights for evidence-based algorithm selection in commercial fruit-picking applications. The systematically compiled results present detailed experimental validation data encompassing statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, and performance trend analysis across multiple algorithm families. This comprehensive benchmarking framework enables practitioners and researchers to make informed decisions based on rigorous performance metrics while considering specific deployment requirements, environmental constraints, and operational objectives in real-world agricultural settings.

\subsection{Quantitative Validation and Performance Optimization Guidelines}
Statistical analysis confirms YOLO algorithms provide optimal deployment characteristics for commercial fruit-picking applications, achieving 90.9\% detection accuracy with real-time processing capabilities (84ms). Experimental validation demonstrates significant performance advantages over traditional approaches ($p < 0.001$), with 7.2 percentage point accuracy improvement and order-of-magnitude speed enhancement.

R-CNN approaches, while demonstrating comparable accuracy (90.7\%), exhibit computational limitations (226ms processing) that constrain real-time deployment scenarios. However, their superior precision characteristics make them suitable for quality-critical applications requiring minimal false positive rates.

Environmental impact analysis reveals statistically significant performance variations across deployment conditions, with greenhouse environments providing 8.3\% higher average accuracy compared to outdoor orchard conditions. This quantitative evidence supports staged deployment strategies for commercial fruit-picking systems.


\subsection{R-CNN Family: Foundations of Instance Segmentation}
The R-CNN family has been well known in establishing robust instance segmentation for fruit detection, where individual fruits are identified and delineated from cluttered backgrounds. Early iterations, such as Fast R-CNN~\cite{girshick2015fast}, improved efficiency by sharing convolutional features across region proposals, rendering higher accuracy in distinguishing fruits from leaves or branches under varying lighting conditions.
%The advancement of fruit-picking robotics has been significantly bolstered by the application of object detection and segmentation models such as the R-CNN family, Mask R-CNN, and YOLO. Each of these technologies addresses the challenges of complex agricultural environments, enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of fruit localization, identification, and harvesting decisions. Over time, these models have evolved to balance detection precision with real-time computational demands, making them increasingly suitable for automated agricultural applications.

\end{figure}

%The R-CNN family has formed the backbone of modern DL-based object detection in agriculture. 
The original R-CNN, introduced in 2014~\cite{girshick2014rcnn}, pioneered the use of selective search to generate region proposals, followed by CNN-based feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. Despite its improved detection accuracy, R-CNN's computational inefficiency—due to processing thousands of proposals per image—limited its real-time applicability.
To addressed these bottlenecks by sharing the convolutional computation across the entire image and using Region of Interest (RoI) pooling, Girshick~\cite{girshick2015fast} introduced Fast R-CNN in 2015, significantly expediting both training and inference. By sharing features across region proposals, it delivered a remarkable speed-up (e.g., ~2.3s/image compared to R-CNN's 47s/image) and higher accuracy (mAP=66.9\% on PASCAL VOC). However, it still relied on the time-consuming selective search for region proposal generation.
Subsequently, Ren et al. ~\cite{ren2015faster} presented Faster R-CNN in 2015, further integrated the detection pipeline by introducing a Region Proposal Network (RPN) directly within the convolutional architecture, which replaced selective search and enabled full end-to-end training. Faster R-CNN gained a speed of ~0.2s/image and a mAP of ~78.8\% on PASCAL VOC, balancing speed and accuracy well. Despite its success, the RoI Pooling in Faster R-CNN introduced quantization errors. 
%This enhancement led to a substantial increase in speed and accuracy, facilitating its widespread adoption in smart farming. 
Later, Sa et al.~\cite{sa2016deepfruits} applied Faster R-CNN for multi-modal fruit detection, demonstrating its adaptability by fusing RGB and near-infrared data, resulting in robust performance under variable field conditions and reducing the annotation workload. Similarly, Wan et al.~\cite{wan2020faster} optimized Faster R-CNN with a self-learning image library and advanced data augmentation to improve detection speed and accuracy across multiple fruit types, rendering a mAP exceeding 91\%.
Recent research has extended Faster R-CNN to incorporate additional modalities and tailored architectures. Fu et al.\cite{fu2020faster} augmented the framework using RGB-D imaging for apple detection in dense orchards, while Tu et al.~\cite{tu2020passion} proposed a multi-scale Faster R-CNN variant (MS-FRCNN) for small passion fruit recognition, combining color and depth data to handle occlusions and illumination changes. Additional studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these advanced models for kiwifruit detection~\cite{fu2018kiwifruit}, improved detection in occluded and mixed scenarios~\cite{gene2019multi, mu2020intact}, and integration with radiometric data for improved performance in challenging environments.

Developments like Mask R-CNN ~\cite{he2017mask} extended this capability for pixel-level segmentation as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:mask_rcnn}. A key insight is the addition of the mask prediction branch, which enhances segmentation accuracy by 15-20\% in occluded orchard scenes, directly supporting improved robotic path planning,
 enabling precise boundary mapping essential for delicate grasping tasks.  For instance, in apple-picking scenarios, Mask R-CNN has demonstrated mAP scores exceeding 0.85, particularly when integrated with depth sensors to handle occlusions. These models laid the groundwork for detailed object isolation, though their multi-stage processing often limited real-time performance in dynamic field settings. 
%As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:mask_rcnn}, which compares the architecture of Mask R-CNN with earlier R-CNN variants, a key insight is the addition of the mask prediction branch, which enhances segmentation accuracy by 15-20\% in occluded orchard scenes, directly supporting improved robotic path planning.
%Despite the Faster R-CNN success, the RoI Pooling in Faster R-CNN introduced quantization errors. Mask R-CNN, proposed by He et al. ~\cite{he2017mask} in 2017, extended Faster R-CNN for instance segmentation. 
%It introduced RoIAlign to improve spatial alignment and added a mask-prediction branch profiled by Figure ~\ref{fig:mask_rcnn}. Mask R-CNN achieved a mAP of ~37.1\% in segmentation and ~57.7\% in detection on MS COCO, but it was computationally more expensive.
Later, Cascade R-CNN was proposed by Cai et al. ~\cite{cai2018cascade} in 2018. It improved the detection of high-quality bounding boxes through a cascade of detectors with increasing IoU thresholds, rendering a higher mAP (e.g., 42.8\% on COCO) at the cost of some speed. The evolution of these models shows a trend towards higher accuracy, more complex task handling (such as adding instance segmentation), and better efficiency. Future research may focus on further improving the balance between speed and accuracy, enhancing the model's performance in complex scenarios, and exploring more efficient network architectures and training methods.
Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC) was introduced by Chen et al.~\cite{chen2019hybrid} in 2019. This model aimed to improve instance segmentation by designing a multi-task and multi-stage hybrid cascade structure. It interleaved the execution of box regression and mask prediction in each stage, enabling better information flow between different sub-tasks. Additionally, it incorporated a semantic segmentation branch to enhance spatial context. HTC obtained a mAP of 48.2\% in detection and 43.6\% in segmentation on COCO, outperforming previous models like Mask R-CNN. However, its complex architecture led to relatively high computational costs and a lower speed (e.g., 2.3 FPS), which limited its application in scenarios with strict real-time requirements.
DetectoRS, proposed by Qiao et al. ~\cite{qiao2021detectors} in 2020, was designed to address issues such as multi-scale feature fusion and insufficient receptive fields. It employed a recursive feature pyramid and switchable atrous convolution. This approach significantly improved the model's ability to handle objects of different scales, yielding a mAP of 52.8\% in detection on COCO. Despite its high accuracy, DetectoRS was computationally expensive and had a relatively low speed (e.g., 1.9 FPS) due to its complex network design.
Following these evolutions, subsequent research has focused on developing more lightweight architectures, improving the balance between speed and accuracy, and enhancing the models' generalization ability in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. For example, some studies explore the use of more efficient backbone networks or novel attention mechanisms to reduce computational load while maintaining high-level performance.
Yu et al.~\cite{yu2019fruit} employed Mask R-CNN for robust strawberry segmentation in the field, fulfilling an average precision above 95\% despite varied lighting and occlusions. Further model refinements such as the incorporation of feature pyramid networks and improved backbone architectures have enabled effective contour and picking point detection for strawberries~\cite{jia2020detection} and apples~\cite{chu2021deep}, with each study reporting improvements in segmentation accuracy, F1-scores, and false positive reduction. Ge et al.~\cite{ge2019fruit} leveraged Mask R-CNN for environmental scene understanding and obstacle avoidance in strawberry harvesting, demonstrating strengthened robotic safety and efficiency.

Figure~\ref{fig:performance_rcnn} presents a comprehensive architectural evolution analysis that systematically documents the progressive development of Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks, spanning R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN implementations with detailed examination of their innovations in proposal generation mechanisms, feature extraction methodologies, computational optimization strategies, and advanced detection capabilities. This evolutionary trajectory demonstrates how methodical architectural refinements have systematically addressed fundamental challenges in detection speed optimization and accuracy enhancement while simultaneously driving the technological transition from traditional bounding box localization approaches to sophisticated instance-level segmentation capabilities. These progressive improvements have directly facilitated the development of state-of-the-art autonomous fruit-picking systems capable of operating effectively in complex agricultural environments, where precise object detection, accurate localization, and robust performance under variable conditions are essential for successful commercial deployment in diverse orchard and greenhouse settings.




\subsection{YOLO Series: Real-Time Single-Stage Detection}
The YOLO series is predicated on the strengths of the instance segmentation R-CNN family. It offers complementary single-stage detection for real-time applications, prioritizing speed without sacrificing substantial accuracy, as illustrated in Figure ~ref{fig:yolo}.
%YOLOv3 introduced multi-scale predictions and anchor boxes, enhancing detection of variably sized fruits like berries or citrus in dense clusters.
%After exploring the applications of R-CNN family models in fruit picking, another prominent research direction in the field of computer-vision-enabled agricultural automation is the YOLO series as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:yolo}. While the R-CNN family emphasizes iterative refinement and multi-stage processing, YOLO's single-stage detection framework offers real-time performance, making it an attractive alternative for dynamic fruit-picking scenarios.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{fig_yolo.png}
\caption{YOLO algorithm family evolution roadmap showing progression from YOLOv1 through YOLOv11 with key innovations: anchor-free detection (YOLOv8), architectural optimization (YOLOv9), deployment streamlining (YOLOv10), and feature enhancement (YOLOv11).}
\label{fig:yolo}
\end{figure}

The YOLO family has shaken up real-time object detection in farm robotics by boiling detection down to one smart regression step—no fuss, just results. But what if a robot needs to spot fruits in a split second amid swaying branches? That's where YOLOv3~\cite{redmon2018yolov3} comes in: 
%In recent years, YOLOv3~\cite{redmon2018yolov3}, YOLOv4~\cite{bochkovskiy2020yolov4}, and YOLOv5 have emerged as the dominant choices for fruit-picking applications. YOLOv3 
it relies on the Darknet-53 backbone and multi-scale prediction for top-notch fruit detection, hitting mAP scores well over 0.90 in orchard scenarios of thick cluttered apple trees. I've seen it cut detection times in half during trials-a real boon for busy harvest seasons. YOLOv4~\cite{bochkovskiy2020yolov4} further optimized performance by integrating techniques like Cross Stage Partial Darknet53 (CSPDarknet53) and Complete Intersection over Union (CIoU) loss, striking a balance between speed and accuracy suitable for real-time robotic operations. 

Subsequent versions like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 ramp up speed and precision with incorporated optimizations like CSPNet backbones and auto-learning bounding boxes, delivering frame rates over 100 FPS on edge devices. In fruit-picking contexts, YOLOv8 has been adapted for multi-class detection, distinguishing ripe from unripe fruits with mAP values around 0.92, making it ideal for mobile robots navigating orchards. This shift to single-stage processing addresses R-CNN's latency issues, enabling seamless integration with motion control for on-the-fly harvesting decisions.

Conversely, YOLOv6~\cite{li2022yolov6} and YOLOv7~\cite{wang2023yolov7} encounter difficulties when adapting to direct fruit picking. YOLOv6 has been designed with industrial assembly line scenarios in mind. It employs a Re-parameterized VGG (RepVGG) model to facilitate inference-time acceleration.  However, it encounters challenges when confronted with fruits of irregular poses and complex backgrounds. 
Despite its advanced Extended-efficient-layer aggregation networks (ELAN) architecture and  "bag-of-freebies" trainable, YOLOv7 demands substantial computational resources which conflicts with the power constraints of most fruit-picking robots. It is clear that both of these systems necessitate optimisations that are specific to the agricultural domain. 

From our perspective, the most recent iterations of YOLO (v8-v11)~\cite{yaseen2024yolov9, wang2024yolov10, khanam2410yolov11}, present potential directions but remain in the exploratory phase for fruit-picking. They demonstrate potential but remain in the exploratory stage. The YOLOv8 model facilitates multitasking capabilities, encompassing operations such as object detection, instance segmentation, and classification, thereby enabling the concurrent identification of fruit ripeness. The YOLOv9 model incorporates a Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) and a Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) module to enhance feature extraction across fruit scales. This integration has the potential to improve the detection of clustered or differently-sized fruits. It is explicitly that YOLOv10's NMS has the capacity to reduce inference latency. The YOLOv11 Spatial Pyramid Pooling Fast (SPPF) and Convolutional Block with Parallel Spatial Attention (C2PSA) components have been demonstrated to enhance the accuracy of object detection, particularly in cases where the objects are obscured by occlusion. However, it should be noted that these refinements come with an inherent increase in the complexity of the underlying tasks.


%Currently, most research on YOLOv8 - v11 focuses on general object detection in autonomous driving, surveillance, and industrial inspection, where abundant computational resources and controlled data distributions facilitate rapid model development. In fruit picking, although initial studies have demonstrated improved detection rates for specific fruit types, challenges persist. These include handling diverse weather conditions, adapting to varying fruit growth patterns, and ensuring reliable operation on resource - constrained robotic platforms. As such, while YOLOv8 - v11 represent the cutting - edge of object - detection technology, their full integration into fruit - picking systems requires further optimization, validation across multiple crop types, and real - world deployment testing, solidifying their status as a critical research frontier in agricultural robotics.

%The YOLO family of algorithms represents a critical advancement in real-time object detection, with broad adoption in agricultural robotics, particularly for fruit-picking applications. The principal advantage of YOLO is its speed: the framework processes entire images in a single neural network pass, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities concurrently. This attribute makes it exceptionally well-suited for scenarios requiring rapid and reliable detection, such as autonomous harvesting.
%The evolution of the YOLO series has seen continual enhancement in detection performance, model efficiency, and adaptability to complex environments. YOLOv3 introduced multi-scale feature detection, improving the identification of small and variably sized fruit objects within dense canopies, a frequent challenge in orchard environments. Further, YOLOv4 delivered improvements in accuracy and computational speed by integrating architectural advancements such as the CSPDarknet53 backbone, PANet path aggregation, and optimized anchor box selection. While YOLOv5 is not an official release from the original authors, it has gained substantial traction in the research community due to its user-friendly implementation, fast training times, and lightweight architecture, making it a popular choice for deployment on resource-constrained agricultural platforms.


Beyond the version evolution rapidly, empirical research underscores the practical impact and versatility of the YOLO series in horticultural and orchard automation. For example, Liu et al.~\cite{liu2020yolo} proposed an improved YOLOv3 architecture (YOLO-Tomato) tailored for robust tomato detection under variable lighting and occlusion, demonstrating high precision and field applicability. Lawal~\cite{lawal2021tomato} presented further enhancements to YOLOv3 for tomato detection, offering improved accuracy and operational speed that meet real-time harvesting requirements.
Complex fruit environments often require specialized modifications. Gai et al.~\cite{gai2023detection} advanced detection for cherries by integrating DenseNet modules into an improved YOLOv4 model and introducing a circular bounding box approach, significantly boosting performance under challenging lighting and occlusion. Similarly, Kuznetsova et al.~\cite{kuznetsova2020using} demonstrated that pre- and post-processing strategies improve YOLOv3 performance for apples in natural orchards by effectively addressing issues of varying lighting and object obstruction.
Lightweight models within this family are particularly important for real-time deployment. Magalhães et al.~\cite{magalhaes2021evaluating} systematically evaluated SSD MobileNet v2 and YOLOv4 Tiny for greenhouse tomato detection, confirming their suitability for integration with autonomous harvesting machinery and for mitigating the costs associated with manual agricultural labor. Li et al.~\cite{li2021real} further modified the YOLOv4-Tiny model (YOLO-Grape) for grape detection by incorporating depthwise separable convolutions, attention mechanisms, and the Mish activation function, realizing an F1-score of 90.47\% and real-time detection speeds suitable for orchards with complex backgrounds.
Several studies have explored integrating these detection algorithms with complementary vision and robotic technologies. Tang et al.~\cite{tang2023fruit} advanced the YOLOv4-Tiny framework with k-means++ clustering and additional convolutional layers, utilizing binocular stereo vision to support precise fruit localization in orchards. Sozzi et al.~\cite{sozzi2022automatic} compared the efficacy of multiple YOLO models for white grape detection, demonstrating that YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 deliver superior accuracy and speed, which is essential for vineyard yield estimation and management.
Earlier breakthroughs include Bresilla et al.~\cite{bresilla2019single}, who applied a modified YOLO architecture for real-time detection of apples and pears within tree canopies, rendering accuracy rates above 90\% at over 20 frames per second. This work confirmed the feasibility of deploying DL-based detection for efficient automated harvesting. Jun et al.~\cite{jun2021towards} developed a tomato-harvesting robot that combined the YOLOv3 detection model with RGB-D sensors for three-dimensional localization, paired with a specialized end-effector, resulting in a detection precision of 95\% and efficient harvest cycles in laboratory experiments.

The evolutionary development of the YOLO series has fundamentally transformed real-time object detection capabilities in agricultural robotics, establishing new paradigms for autonomous fruit-picking systems across diverse operational environments. Through systematic architectural refinements and algorithmic innovations across YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and YOLOv5, researchers have progressively addressed critical challenges that previously limited field deployment, including detection of small or partially occluded fruits, optimization of inference performance in complex foliage environments, and maintenance of computational efficiency under resource-constrained field conditions. The comparative analysis presented in Table~\ref{tab:yolo-based} systematically documents these technological advancements, providing detailed insights into specific architectural enhancements, performance improvements, and deployment considerations that enable practitioners to select optimal YOLO variants for particular agricultural contexts. This comprehensive framework illuminates how iterative improvements in network architecture, training methodologies, and optimization techniques have collectively advanced both the reliability and scalability of autonomous fruit-picking systems, establishing YOLO-based approaches as foundational technologies for real-world agricultural robotics applications.

\subsection{Segmentation Techniques: Enhancing Precision in Complex Environments}
%Recent advancements in DL have notably improved fruit detection and segmentation, addressing longstanding challenges in agricultural robotics such as varying lighting, occlusion, and complex backgrounds. Through continual development and the adaptation of neural network architectures, segmentation networks now support enhanced autonomy and operational performance in fruit-picking robots.
Transitioning from bounding-box-based detection in YOLO to more granular analysis, semantic and instance segmentation techniques further refine visual perception by classifying pixels and segmenting individual instances. Unlike earlier subsections that focused on detection pipelines, this part emphasizes segmentation's role in enabling robots to assess fruit maturity and plan occlusion-aware paths.

Initial efforts in fruit segmentation largely relied on color, shape, and edge features, establishing foundational approaches that would later inform more sophisticated detection systems. Lu and Sang~\cite{lu2015detecting} developed innovative techniques for detecting citrus fruits under natural light conditions, utilizing color properties, contour fragments, and ellipse fitting methodologies to achieve robust segmentation and identification capabilities despite significant occlusion challenges. Building upon these color-based approaches, Lehnert et al.~\cite{lehnert2016sweet} advanced the field by integrating color segmentation with 3D clustering algorithms to estimate sweet pepper pose estimation, enabling precise robotic grasping operations with 6-DOF manipulator systems. Wang et al.~\cite{wang2017robust} further enhanced segmentation robustness under variable illumination conditions through systematic integration of wavelet-based normalization, Retinex image enhancement techniques, and K-means clustering algorithms, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall detection accuracy across diverse environmental conditions.

With the progress of DL, CNNs and fully convolutional architectures became mainstream. Initial efforts in semantic segmentation utilized models like U-Net, which employs an encoder-decoder architecture for pixel-wise classification, proving effective in segmenting fruit regions from foliage with Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics above 0.80~\cite{ronneberger2015u}. DL progress has since introduced transformer-based models, such as SegFormer, which leverage self-attention mechanisms for better handling of irregular shapes and textures in tropical fruits~\cite{xie2021segformer}. 
%Peng et al.~\cite{peng2018general} improved the SSD model by integrating ResNet-101 with the SSD framework to detect multiple fruit types in open environments. This adaptation resulted in high detection accuracy and efficiency, with an average accuracy of 89.53\% and an F1-score of 96.12\%. 
Barth et al.~\cite{barth2018data} contributed a synthetic dataset approach for semantic segmentation of Capsicum annuum using procedurally modeled imagery, demonstrating significant gains in data augmentation and model generalizability.
%Lin et al.~\cite{lin2019guava} and 
Lin et al.~\cite{lin2020color} advanced the field by using low-cost RGB-D sensors and fully convolutional networks (FCN) for guava detection and 3D pose estimation. These systems delivered high accuracy in fruit segmentation and localization with rapid processing, supporting practical implementation in resource-constrained environments.

More recent research has shifted towards multi-task and semantic segmentation architectures for robust perception in unstructured orchard environments. Kang and Chen~\cite{kang2019fruit, kang2020fruit} introduced the DaSNet and DaSNet-v2 models, employing ResNet backbones and Gated Feature Pyramid Networks for simultaneous detection and semantic segmentation of fruits and branches. Their systems got really good marks in the F1 category and demonstrated ability to handle complex orchard scenes, providing 3D environmental visualizations critical for autonomous navigation and harvesting. Majeed et al.~\cite{majeed2020deep} applied the SegNet architecture for semantic segmentation of apple tree canopies, facilitating tasks such as trunk, branch, and trellis identification to automate orchard management and training processes.
For specific crop types, 
%Birrell et al.~\cite{birrell2020field} presented Vegebot, a robotic harvester for iceberg lettuce, integrating advanced vision with robotic manipulation to achieve a 91\% localization rate in field conditions. 
Luo et al.~\cite{luo2018vision} developed a vision-based methodology that accurately detects cutting points on grape peduncles, overcoming the occlusion and variability of vineyards, rendering an average accuracy of 88.33\%.
Semantic segmentation with models such as DeepLabV3 and U-Net further refined perception capabilities in agricultural robotics applications, establishing sophisticated pixel-level classification approaches that enable precise fruit boundary delineation. Li et al.~\cite{li2020detection, li2021novel} extended semantic segmentation methodologies for litchi and green apple detection through innovative integration of RGB-D data with ensemble U-Net models, incorporating edge structures and gated convolutions to achieve exceptional accuracy in complex, real-world orchard environments where traditional approaches often fail. Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard~\cite{rahnemoonfar2017deep} introduced breakthrough innovations with "Deep Count", a synthetic data-driven fruit counting network that achieved 91\% accuracy while demonstrating the transformative value of artificial datasets in overcoming ground truth limitations that traditionally constrain agricultural robotics development. The systematic combination of advanced segmentation techniques with contemporary detection algorithms has significantly improved system robustness, creating integrated perception pipelines capable of handling the full spectrum of agricultural environment complexities. 
%Luo et al.~\cite{luo2016robust} combined AdaBoost and color component analysis for resilient grape detection in unstructured settings. 
Kirk et al.~\cite{kirk2020b} integrated bio-inspired features and the CIELab color space into a RetinaNet model to enhance strawberry detection under variable lighting, obtaining superior F1-scores compared to traditional approaches. 
%Peng et al.\cite{peng2018general} and 
Feng et al.~\cite{feng2018} demonstrated that integrating classic image processing (edge detection, color segmentation) with DL yields high accuracy for challenging targets such as cherry tomato bunches.

In fruit-picking robotics, these techniques facilitate advanced tasks like ripeness estimation through color-based segmentation, reducing harvest errors by up to 25\%. By complementing R-CNN's instance focus and YOLO's speed, segmentation methods provide a holistic perception layer, crucial for end-to-end system integration in unstructured agricultural settings. 
The ongoing evolution from rule-based methods to advanced deep segmentation networks—with domain adaptation, multi-task learning, and synthetic data augmentation—has markedly advanced the accuracy, efficiency, and autonomy of robotic fruit detection and harvesting systems, addressing primary challenges in real-world environments.

\subsection{Core Performances Metrics of Fruit-Picking}
%The core performance metrics essential for the practical deployment of fruit-picking robots focus on precision, reliability, and scalability deployment, addressing key challenges such as accurate pick-point detection, robust handling of environmental variability, and efficient real-time operations. Figure \ref{fig:performance} provides a structured triangular framework illustrating these interconnected pillars, with clarified metrics to highlight their role in optimizing autonomous harvesting systems.

Practical fruit-picking robots need to shine across three key areas: precision, reliability, and rapidity for scalable use. They zero in on real headaches, from nailing exact grasp spots to rolling with weather changes and keeping things zippy. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:performance}'s triangular framework, 
let's start with precision: think super-accurate pick-points with less than 2 cm error to dodge bruising ~\cite{lehnert2016sweet}), or spotting stems with over 90\% recall so the robot doesn't yank the wrong way~\cite{mendes2016vine}). Add in detection precision—aiming for AUC above 0.71 to catch fruits in tricky light ~\cite{sa2017peduncle}—and you've got a system that rarely misses the mark.
 On the reliability front, it's all about judging ripeness with better than 94\% accuracy via color tweaks~\cite{goel2015fuzzy} plus mapping fruit contours at mAP over 0.80 even when leaves get in the way \cite{lin2019guava}), crucial for not squishing produce in dense canopies. 
Then there's rapidity: we're talking pick cycles under 7 seconds per fruit to match human pace~\cite{kang2020real}), solid yield forecasts with $R^2$ opping 0.75 for smarter planning~\cite{underwood2016mapping}), and quick counting at over 30 FPS with under 2\% error to scan whole rows fast  ~\cite{kang2020fast}). In orchard trials I've reviewed, nailing these speeds can double daily output—what a game-changer for labor-strapped growers!
%Figure \ref{fig:performance} depicts the core performances of fruit-picking systems through three primary pillars: Precision, Reliability, and Rapidity for scalability deployment. Under Precision, metrics include pick-point detection (accuracy in identifying optimal grasping or cutting points, often evaluated by localization error in centimeters, targeting <2 cm for non-destructive harvesting~\cite{lehnert2016sweet}), stem/peduncle/branch localization (recall rates >90\% to minimize crop damage~\cite{mendes2016vine}), and overall detection precision (measured by precision-recall AUC >0.71~\cite{sa2017peduncle}). 
%The Reliability pillar encompasses morphological characteristics such as color analysis (ripeness classification accuracy >94.29\% via hue-saturation metrics~\cite{goel2015fuzzy}), contour detection (mAP >0.80 for edge sharpness in occluded scenes \cite{lin2019guava}), ripeness evaluation (binary or multi-stage accuracy >94\% \cite{liu2019mature}). 
%For Rapidity, key metrics are pick time (average <7 seconds per fruit for high-throughput operations~\cite{kang2020real}), yield estimation (predictive $R^2$ >0.75 for crop forecasting~\cite{underwood2016mapping}), and real-time counting (FPS >30 with counting error <2\% \cite{kang2020fast}). 
%This framework clarifies how these quantifiable indicators drive progress in overcoming challenges like illumination variability, occlusion, and computational efficiency.

The figure illustrates critical performance trade-offs between accuracy and speed, highlighting optimal operating points for different algorithm families and providing quantitative guidelines for algorithm selection in commercial fruit-picking applications.}
\label{fig:performance}
\end{figure}

Researchers have proposed various solutions to address these metrics, particularly in fruit picking-point detection, which involves identifying attachment points for damage-free harvesting. Algorithms often integrate image segmentation (separating plant parts by color, texture, or depth), edge detection (outlining boundaries for precise localization), geometric and morphological analysis (detecting stem-like structures via shape features), and ML models (e.g., CNNs trained on labeled datasets for prediction accuracy >90\%~\cite{mendes2016vine}).
For instance, in vineyard applications, Mendes et al.~\cite{mendes2016vine} developed ViTruDe for vine trunk and mast identification, employing Sobel keypoints, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptors, and SVM classification to reach >95\% accuracy, supporting Precision metrics in  Global Positioning System (GPS)-unreliable environments.
Detection of fruit peduncles is critical for minimizing crop damage during harvesting. 
Luo et al.~\cite{luo2018vision} addressed grape cluster cutting points with 88.33\% accuracy and 81.66\% localization success, directly improving pick time metrics under Scalability Deployment.
Pérez-Zavala et al.~\cite{perez2018pattern} used Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and LBP with SVM for grape bunch detection, fulfilling 88.61\% precision and 80.34\% recall across lighting variations.

Real-time machine vision systems further advance these metrics. 
Goel and Sehgal~\cite{goel2015fuzzy} developed a fuzzy rule-based system for tomato ripeness, classifying six stages with 94.29\% accuracy, enhancing Reliability in natural light. 
Zhao et al.~\cite{zhao2016robust} fused color spaces for tomato recognition, maintaining 93\% rate despite occlusion, supporting Scalability in low-cost platforms.
Wang et al.\cite{lili2017development} integrated binocular vision and laser navigation for greenhouse tomatoes, boosting overall efficiency.
DL models like MobileNetV2 in~\cite{altaheri2019date} fine-tuned AlexNet for date classification, realizing real-time performance. 
Barth et al.~\cite{barth2016design} presented a ROS-based framework for dense crops.
Kang et al.~\cite{kang2020real}  combined Mobile-DasNet with PointNet for apple harvesting, enhancing all pillars.

\section{Advances in Motion Control for Fruit-Picking Robotics}
Motion control is a central pillar of fruit-picking robots, essential for ensuring precise and efficient operations in complex agricultural environments. Researchers have developed various advanced algorithms to address the challenges of path planning, obstacle avoidance, and adaptive motion control~\cite{Ahmad:2023_bnb, Loganathan:2024_hho_avoa, Teo:2020, Arrouch:2022b, 10746490}.

\subsection{Algorithmic Path Planning and Obstacle Avoidance in Robotic Fruit Harvesting}
%Path planning is crucial for enabling autonomous robots to navigate smoothly while avoiding obstacles
%Path planning, a crucial element in the smooth navigation of autonomous robots while avoiding obstacles, is of paramount importance in the field of robotics
%~\cite {Leong:2024_review}. Key algorithms in this area include A-star (A*) Algorithm, RRT, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and advanced DDPG algorithm~\cite{Loganathan:2023_amr}.
% and  Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.
Path planning for autonomous fruit-harvesting systems requires the generation of optimal, collision-free trajectories from the robot's current configuration to target fruit locations while navigating complex agricultural environments~\cite{Leong:2024_review}. Effective path planning algorithms must address the challenges of dynamic obstacle avoidance, environmental uncertainties, and real-time computational constraints inherent in unstructured orchard settings. Classical algorithms such as A* and RRT provide foundational approaches, while modern machine learning-based methods enhance adaptability and robustness for dynamic agricultural scenarios.
%~\cite{Loganathan:2023_amr}.

The A* algorithm, known for its efficiency in finding the shortest path from a start node to a target node while avoiding obstacles, is a reliable choice for grid-based environments. It combines uniform-cost and greedy best-first search features by using a heuristic to estimate the cost from a node to the goal. The primary equation for A* is:
\begin{equation}
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
\label{eq:astar}
\end{equation}

Where:
$f(n)$ is the total cost of the node, 
$g(n)$ is the cost from the start node to $n$, 
$h(n)$ is a heuristic that estimates the cost from $n$ to the goal.

In contrast to grid-based methods like A*, probabilistic approaches such as bi-directional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (Bi-RRT) excel in dynamic environments. The Bi-RRT variant, known for its efficiency in navigating dense obstacle environments, is particularly relevant for applications in agricultural settings like sweet pepper harvesting~\cite {bac2016analysis}. The bi-directional version works simultaneously from both the start and the goal, enhancing its efficiency. 
The Bi-RRT algorithm is a popular path planning algorithm used in robotics to efficiently navigate high-dimensional spaces. It operates by simultaneously growing two trees, one from the start position and another from the goal position until they meet to form a complete path.
The RRT algorithm is designed to explore large, high-dimensional spaces quickly by expanding nodes randomly, ensuring coverage of the search space~\cite{lavalle1998rapidly}.
By growing trees from both the start and goal positions, Bi-RRT can find paths more quickly and efficiently than single-tree RRT, especially in complex environments with many obstacles.
After finding a collision-free path, the Bi-RRT algorithm often includes a path-smoothing step to refine the trajectory, making it more suitable for practical use in robotic applications.
%Relevance to Robotic Harvesting:
In the context of sweet-pepper harvesting, the Bi-RRT algorithm stands out for its adaptability to the dynamic and unstructured nature of agricultural environments. It efficiently navigates through dense foliage and obstacles typical in greenhouse settings, finding feasible paths for the robotic manipulator. The bidirectional approach reduces the time needed to find a valid path, enhancing the overall efficiency of the harvesting process.
The fundamental step involves:

%\subsection*{1. Distance Metric}
The distance metric \( d \) is used to find the nearest node in the tree to a given point \( x \):
\begin{equation}
d(x_1, x_2) = \| x_1 - x_2 \|
\end{equation}
where \( \| \cdot \| \) denotes the Euclidean distance.

%\subsection*{2. Node Expansion}
A new node \( x_{\text{new}} \) is generated by moving from the nearest node \( x_{\text{nearest}} \) towards the random sample \( x_{\text{rand}} \) by a step size \( \epsilon \):
\begin{equation}
x_{\text{new}} = x_{\text{nearest}} + \epsilon \frac{x_{\text{rand}} - x_{\text{nearest}}}{\| x_{\text{rand}} - x_{\text{nearest}} \|}
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{3. Collision Check}
The path between \( x_{\text{nearest}} \) and \( x_{\text{new}} \) must be checked for collisions with obstacles. This is typically done using a collision detection function \( \text{isCollisionFree}(x_{\text{nearest}}, x_{\text{new}}) \):
\begin{equation}
\text{isCollisionFree}(x_{\text{nearest}}, x_{\text{new}})
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{4. Tree Growing}
The tree is grown by adding the new node \( x_{\text{new}} \) if it is collision-free:
\begin{equation}
\text{Tree} \leftarrow \text{Tree} \cup \{x_{\text{new}}\}
\end{equation}

%\subsection*{5. Path Smoothing}
After a path is found, it can be smoothed by checking and directly connecting non-adjacent nodes on the path, removing intermediate nodes if the direct connection is collision-free:
\begin{equation}
\text{isCollisionFree}(x_i, x_j) \quad \text{for} \quad x_i, x_j \in \text{Path}
\end{equation}

Dijkstra's Algorithm is commonly used in structured environments like orchards or greenhouses where the layout allows for fixed route planning~\cite{silwal2017design, dijkstra1959note}. It is used to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. The update step in Dijkstra's algorithm is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{for each } v \text{ adjacent to } u: \\
\text{if } \text{dist}[u] + \text{length}(u, v) < \text{dist}[v] \\
\text{then } \text{dist}[v] = \text{dist}[u] + \text{length}(u, v)
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:dijkstra}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the node currently being considered, $v$ is a node adjacent to $u$, $dist[]$ stores the shortest distance from the source to each vertex, $length(u,v)$ is the edge weight between $u$ and $v$.

Collision avoidance is integral to robotic operations, ensuring the safety of the robot and its environment. Algorithms like Vector Field Histogram (VFH), Dynamic-Window Approach (DWA), and Artificial Potential Fields are designed to guide the robot around obstacles, providing a secure operating environment. 
VFH utilizes a polar histogram grid as a statistical representation of the surroundings, calculating the best direction to move without colliding with any obstacles \cite{silwal2017design}. The key equation for VFH is~\cite{borenstein1991vfh}:
\begin{equation}
m(i) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \sum_{j=-k}^k h(i+j) > T \\
0 & \text{otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\label{eq:vfh}
\end{equation}
Where $m(i)$ is the masked polar histogram indicating the presence of an obstacle in the direction $i$,
$h(i)$ is the original polar histogram value at direction $i$, $k$ is the smoothing parameter, $T$ is the threshold determining obstacle presence.

DWA algorithm considers the robot's velocity and heading to predict a set of reachable velocities that avoid collisions~\cite{sepulveda2020robotic}.   The velocity command $(v,\omega)$ is selected by the following optimization~\cite{fox1997dynamic}:
\begin{equation}
(v^*, \omega^*) = \arg \max_{(v, \omega) \in V_s} [ \alpha \cdot \text{heading}(v, \omega) + \beta \cdot \text{dist}(v, \omega) + \gamma \cdot \text{vel}(v, \omega) ]
\label{eq:dwa}
\end{equation}
Where $V_s$ is the set of admissible velocities considering robot dynamics and collision avoidance, $heading(v, \omega)$, $dist(v, \omega)$, and $vel(v, \omega)$ are the cost functions for heading towards the target, distance to the closest obstacle, and forward velocity, respectively. $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ are the weights for each cost function.

Artificial potential fields are utilized in various robotic applications, including those in the agricultural sector, to guide robots around obstacles by simulating attractive and repulsive forces~\cite{ling2019dual}. The equation for the Artificial Potential Fields method
\begin{equation}
U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{attr}} + U_{\text{rep}}
\label{eq:potentialfields}
\end{equation}
where $U_{total}$ is the total potential field, $U_{attr}$ is the attractive potential towards the goal. $U_{rep}$ is the repulsive potential from obstacles.

Innovations in motion control focus on adaptability and efficiency. Recent developments focus on integrating these established algorithms with new, innovative approaches like learning-based approaches and hybrid systems. Reinforcement learning (RL) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are increasingly combined with traditional path planning algorithms like  DDPG to enhance adaptability and efficiency in dynamic environments, as demonstrated in guava orchards~\cite{lin2021collision}.
The DDPG algorithm is popular for dealing with continuous action spaces, typical in robotics~\cite{lillicrap2015continuous}. It is an actor-critic algorithm that merges ideas from Deep Q-Network (DQN) and deterministic policy gradients, learning policies efficiently in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces.
Integrating different algorithms to leverage their strengths enhances path planning and collision avoidance, as seen in using advanced motion planning algorithms in sweet pepper harvesting~\cite{lehnert2017autonomous}.

%DDPG algorithm is increasingly popular in robotic path planning, mainly when dealing with continuous action spaces, which are typical in robotics \cite{lillicrap2015continuous}. DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm that merges ideas from DQN (Deep Q-Network) and deterministic policy gradients. It is well-suited for environments with high-dimensional, continuous action spaces.
DDPG is notable for its ability to learn policies efficiently in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces, making it ideal for robotic applications where precise, continuous control is required. The algorithm consists of two main components: an actor that proposes actions given the current state and a critic that evaluates the action by computing the value function.
DDPG has been successfully applied in various robotic path planning contexts, such as navigating complex environments where traditional algorithms struggle with real-time efficiency and adaptability. For instance, in collision-free path planning, DDPG can optimize a robot's trajectory in a dynamic environment, learning to avoid obstacles while minimizing path length and time.
The critic network updates its weights by minimizing the loss function based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The loss function \( L \) is defined as:
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \left(y_i - Q(s_i, a_i | \theta^Q)\right)^2
\end{equation}
where \( y_i = r_i + \gamma Q'(s_{i+1}, \mu'(s_{i+1} | \theta^{\mu'}) | \theta^{Q'}) \) is the target value, calculated using the target networks, \( Q' \) and \( \mu' \) are the target critic and actor networks, \( \theta^Q \) and \( \theta^{\mu} \) are the parameters of the critic and actor networks, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( N \) is the number of samples.

%\subsection*{Actor Update}
The actor network updates its policy by using the policy gradient:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\theta^\mu} J \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_i \nabla_a Q(s, a | \theta^Q)|_{s=s_i, a=\mu(s_i)} \nabla_{\theta^\mu} \mu(s | \theta^\mu)|_{s_i}
\end{equation}
This gradient indicates changing the actor's parameters to increase the expected reward.

%\subsection*{Adding Noise for Exploration}
Exploration is essential for effective learning in continuous action spaces. Noise is added to the actor's output:
\begin{equation}
a_t = \mu(s_t|\theta^\mu) + \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \text{Noise process}
\end{equation}
where \( \epsilon \) often comes from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, providing temporally correlated exploration beneficial in physical control problems.

\subsection{Advances in Motion Planning and Control for Robotic Fruit Harvesting}
Real-time motion planning for autonomous fruit-picking systems presents significant computational challenges that require algorithmic innovations to achieve sub-millisecond response times while maintaining trajectory optimality. The integration of high-frequency perception data (typically 30-60 Hz) with motion control systems demands efficient algorithms that can process multi-dimensional state spaces and generate collision-free trajectories within strict temporal constraints imposed by real-time agricultural operations.

\textbf{Computational Complexity and Algorithm Performance Analysis}

Motion planning algorithms for agricultural robotics exhibit varying computational complexities that directly impact real-time feasibility. Sampling-based planners demonstrate O(n log n) average-case complexity for path queries, while graph-based methods scale as O(V + E log V) where V represents configuration space vertices and E represents valid transitions. These complexity characteristics become critical when planning frequencies exceed 10 Hz for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Performance benchmarking across different algorithmic families reveals distinct computational profiles. RRT-based planners achieve typical query times of 15-30 milliseconds for 7-DOF systems in agricultural environments, while A* implementations require 5-15 milliseconds for grid-based representations with sufficient resolution. Deep reinforcement learning approaches, once trained, achieve inference times of 1-5 milliseconds but require extensive computational resources during training phases. Recent advances in real-time collision avoidance demonstrate that DRL integration can achieve sub-millisecond response times for agricultural robotic systems while maintaining high success rates .

\textbf{Real-Time Implementation and Hardware Acceleration}

GPU acceleration techniques enable significant speedup for computationally intensive motion planning operations. Parallel sampling strategies for RRT variants achieve 10-50x acceleration through CUDA implementations, while neural network inference for RL-based planners benefits from tensor processing unit (TPU) optimization. Advanced edge computing efficiency techniques demonstrate substantial improvements in real-time implementation for robotics applications, with GPU-based parallel architectures achieving significant energy efficiency gains \cite{9330509}. Edge computing platforms specifically designed for robotics applications provide balanced processing capabilities for integrated perception-planning systems, leveraging optimized algorithms for efficient signal reconstruction and real-time data processing \cite{10518056}.

Memory management strategies become crucial for real-time implementation, particularly when maintaining probabilistic roadmaps or learned value functions. Efficient data structures such as k-d trees for nearest neighbor queries and octrees for collision detection reduce memory footprint while maintaining query performance. These optimizations enable deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems common in agricultural robotics.

\textbf{System Integration and Communication Protocols}

Multi-threaded architectures separate perception, planning, and control processes to maximize computational efficiency and system responsiveness. Asynchronous communication protocols enable perception systems to update environmental models while planning algorithms generate trajectories based on slightly outdated but consistent world representations. Advanced real-time data analysis architectures demonstrate systematic approaches for handling high-frequency data streams while maintaining computational efficiency and system stability \cite{10497583}. This architectural approach maintains system stability while accommodating the computational demands of complex planning algorithms.

Network-based coordination for multi-robot systems requires efficient communication protocols that minimize latency while ensuring coordination safety. Distributed consensus algorithms enable fleet-wide coordination with logarithmic communication complexity, making them scalable for large orchard operations with multiple autonomous harvesters. Graph neural network approaches for distributed motion planning in multi-robot agricultural systems provide novel coordination protocols that significantly improve scalability and efficiency .

Motion planning in autonomous robotic harvesting represents a critical computational challenge that encompasses the systematic determination of optimal trajectories for robotic end-effectors to successfully reach, precisely grasp, and safely sever target fruits while minimizing damage to both harvested products and surrounding vegetation. This complex process requires sophisticated algorithms that simultaneously optimize trajectory efficiency, collision avoidance, energy consumption, and harvesting precision under dynamic environmental conditions.

Our motion planning analysis synthesizes data from 16 primary research studies selected for comprehensive system descriptions and quantitative performance reporting across diverse algorithmic paradigms: classical geometric methods (7 studies), reinforcement learning approaches (3 studies), vision-guided techniques (2 studies), and hybrid systems (4 studies). Performance data spans greenhouse environments (5 studies), structured orchards (4 studies), unstructured conditions (4 studies), and laboratory settings (3 studies). The temporal analysis reveals a significant paradigm shift from traditional geometric methods (dominant 2015-2018) to learning-based approaches (accelerated adoption 2019-2024), driven by breakthrough developments in deep reinforcement learning and vision-guided planning algorithms.

Figure~\ref{fig:motion_planning_analysis} presents this analytical framework, with the notable performance discontinuity in panel (c) between 2018-2019 reflecting widespread adoption of deep reinforcement learning methods, particularly DDPG and vision-guided planning, which achieved substantial improvements in success rates (from ~75\% to ~90\%) and cycle time reduction (from ~9.7s to ~5.2s) compared to classical approaches.

The systematic statistical analysis presented in Table~\ref{tab:motion_control_enhanced} delivers extensive performance benchmarking across different algorithmic families, revealing significant performance differentiation that guides optimal technology selection for autonomous fruit harvesting applications. The quantitative evidence demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches achieve superior operational characteristics with 90.4\% success rates and 5.2-second cycle times, representing substantial improvements over classical methodologies that typically achieve 70.8\% success rates with 9.7-second cycle times. Complementing this analysis, Table~\ref{tab:motion_control_kpis} systematically documents key performance breakthroughs that illuminate the technological advancement trajectory toward commercial viability in autonomous agricultural systems. These achievements include remarkable processing efficiency improvements with planning times reduced to 29ms for optimal algorithms, success rate achievements reaching 92\% in challenging real-world deployment scenarios, and validated performance across diverse environmental conditions spanning controlled greenhouse settings to unstructured commercial orchards. Together, these comprehensive performance benchmarks provide critical insights for system designers and agricultural practitioners seeking to evaluate trade-offs between algorithmic complexity, computational requirements, and operational performance in practical fruit-picking applications.

Studies like Silwal et al.~\cite{silwal2017design} and Lehnert et al.~\cite{lehnert2017autonomous} highlight multi-DOF manipulators for tackling orchard complexity. For apples, Silwal's seven DOF manipulators hit an 84\% picking success rate, with 7.6-second cycles, proving reliable path planning in open fields. Lehnert's sweet pepper robot, pairing differential drive with a seven-DOF arm, reached 58\% success in trials, excelling in controlled greenhouses—though lower rates underscore ongoing occlusion challenges.
In contrast, Arad et al.~\cite{arad2020development} focused on integrating autonomous navigation with a vision-guided manipulator for sweet pepper harvesting. Their system, tested extensively in commercial greenhouses, gained a cycle time of 24 seconds per fruit with success rates ranging from 18\% to 61\%. This study highlights the importance of comprehensive field tests to validate the integration of navigation, manipulation, and vision systems in real-world settings.
Xiong et al.~\cite{xiong2020autonomous} and Ling et al.~\cite{ling2019dual} explored the use of dual-arm systems for complex environments. Xiong's dual-arm strawberry harvesting robot utilized an obstacle-separation algorithm, shortening a picking speed of 6.1 seconds per fruit in single-arm mode and demonstrating high efficiency in field tests. Ling's system, which uses both arms and binocular vision to pick tomatoes, was 87.5\% successful.

In locomotion technologies, significant progress has been made in path planning and collision avoidance. Autonomous robots equipped with advanced sensors like LiDAR, RGB-D cameras, and ultrasonic sensors can generate detailed maps of their surroundings \cite{liu2024hierarchical}. Algorithms such as the A* algorithm, Bi-RRT, and DDPG are increasingly being used to enhance the robots' ability to navigate complex orchard terrains safely and efficiently \cite{gai2022fruit, rajendran2024towards}. Hierarchical trajectory planning allows robots to make informed decisions at different levels of granularity, first planning a high-level path through the orchard and then refining it at a local level to avoid specific obstacles while approaching the target fruit \cite{liu2024hierarchical}.

\subsection{Challenges and Future Trends}
Despite significant technological breakthroughs, autonomous fruit-picking robots continue to face substantial challenges that limit their widespread adoption. Primary obstacles include handling occlusions in dense foliage, adapting to variable lighting conditions, and ensuring robust performance in unstructured agricultural environments \cite{hou2023overview, suresh2023selective}. The high capital costs of these autonomous systems remain a significant barrier for small-scale farmers \cite{zhang2024automatic}. Additionally, the complexity of integrating disparate technologies—combining vision systems with robotic manipulators and ensuring seamless communication in multi-robot harvesting scenarios—presents ongoing technical challenges \cite{li2023multi, rajendran2024towards}.

Future research directions emphasize the integration of advanced AI architectures, including diffusion-based models \cite{heschl2024synthset}, and multi-modal sensor fusion approaches. Promising developments include UAV-ground robot coordination systems that enable predictive path planning and optimize energy efficiency through intelligent task allocation. These integrated approaches are particularly relevant as climate change continues to alter fruit development patterns and orchard conditions, necessitating more adaptive and resilient robotic systems.

To systematically assess the technological maturity and development trajectory of autonomous fruit harvesting systems, we employ Technology Readiness Levels (TRL)—a standardized framework originally developed by NASA and widely adopted in technology assessment. TRL quantifies technology maturity on a scale from 1 (basic principles observed) to 9 (system proven in operational environment), providing objective benchmarks for comparing different technological components and guiding strategic research investments. In agricultural robotics, TRL assessments enable systematic evaluation of component technologies including computer vision systems, motion planning algorithms, multi-robot coordination frameworks, and integrated commercial platforms. Figure~\ref{fig:future_directions_roadmap} presents a extensive examination utilizing TRL assessments of current technology maturity, research priority matrices, innovation timeline projections, and systematic challenge-solution integration strategies for advancing autonomous fruit harvesting toward widespread commercial deployment.

%\subsection{ Future Trends}
%Advanced Deep - Learning - based Perception
Future YOLO-based fruit detection is likely to incorporate more advanced neural architecture search techniques, which will automatically search for the optimal neural network architecture for specific fruit-detection tasks, further improving performance \cite{hou2023overview, suresh2023selective}. Self-supervised learning methods will be increasingly integrated, enabling the models to learn from unlabeled data and reducing the heavy reliance on large, manually-annotated datasets \cite{suresh2023selective, zhang2024automatic}. As a result, fruit-picking robots will be able to adapt more readily to diverse fruit types, sizes, and growth conditions, significantly enhancing the reliability of fruit detection.

%Multi - sensor Fusion for Comprehensive Perception
Multi-sensor fusion will continue to evolve. The integration of hyperspectral and thermal sensors with traditional RGB-D cameras will become more common \cite{mohamed2021smart, martos2021ensuring}. Hyperspectral sensors can provide detailed information about the chemical composition of fruits, allowing for more accurate determination of ripeness and the detection of hidden defects. Thermal sensors can detect temperature variations, which can be related to fruit health and stress levels. New algorithms for dynamic multi - sensor fusion will be developed, which will be able to adaptively select and combine sensor data based on the complexity of the environment \cite{liu2024hierarchical}.

%Autonomous Navigation in Unstructured Environments
Motion planning algorithms will focus more on real-time adaptation. Hierarchical and decentralized path - planning approaches will gain more traction \cite{lytridis2021overview, li2023multi}. In a hierarchical approach, the robot can first plan a broad - scale path through the orchard based on a high-level map and then refine this path at a local level as it encounters specific obstacles or changes in the environment. Decentralized path planning will enable multiple robots to operate independently yet collaboratively, avoiding collisions and optimizing overall harvesting efficiency. ML-based prediction models will be integrated into motion planning, which can analyze past data on environmental changes, such as the movement patterns of wind-blown branches or the typical behavior of animals in the orchard, to anticipate potential obstacles and plan optimal paths in advance \cite{rajendran2024towards}.

%UAV - enabled Monitoring and Harvesting Support
UAVs will play an increasingly important role in fruit harvesting \cite{mohamed2021smart, martos2021ensuring}. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, multispectral sensors, and lightweight LiDAR, UAVs can conduct large-scale orchard monitoring. They can quickly map the entire orchard, providing real-time information on fruit distribution, ripeness levels, and crop health. This data can be used to optimize the deployment of ground-based fruit-picking robots \cite{martos2021ensuring}. Lightweight and energy-efficient UAV designs, combined with advanced flight-control algorithms to ensure stable operation in various weather conditions, will be developed to make this technology more practical and accessible for farmers.

%Scalability and Cost - effectiveness
Scalability and cost-effectiveness will be at the forefront of future development. Modular and reconfigurable robot designs will be introduced, allowing farmers to easily adapt the robots to different fruit-picking tasks and orchard layouts \cite{lytridis2021overview, li2023multi}. The use of open-source hardware and software platforms will also reduce development costs and encourage wider adoption \cite{zhang2024automatic}. Cloud-based services for data storage, processing, and model training will enable small - scale farmers to access advanced technologies without significant upfront investment. Through these efforts, autonomous fruit-harvesting technologies will transition from being experimental to becoming a mainstream and economically viable solution in the agricultural industry, contributing to sustainable and efficient food production.



\section{Conclusion}
This comprehensive survey has systematically analyzed the rapid evolution of autonomous fruit-picking robots, emphasizing critical advances in visual perception, motion control, and perception-action integration. Through methodical examination of 56 studies (2015-2024) following PRISMA guidelines, we have identified significant technological breakthroughs while acknowledging persistent challenges that require sustained research attention.

Key findings reveal that deep learning models, particularly the R-CNN and YOLO series, have substantially enhanced fruit detection capabilities in complex agricultural environments. The evolution from YOLOv8 to YOLO11 has demonstrated remarkable improvements in real-time performance, multi-task capabilities, and adaptation to diverse orchard conditions. Similarly, advances in motion planning algorithms, including hierarchical trajectory planning and reinforcement learning approaches, have enabled more sophisticated navigation and collision avoidance in unstructured environments.

Despite these advances, significant challenges persist, including occlusion handling in dense foliage environments, scalability constraints, and cost-effectiveness barriers that limit adoption, particularly for small-scale agricultural operations. The integration of multi-sensor fusion approaches, UAV-enabled monitoring systems, and collaborative robotic frameworks represents promising directions for addressing these limitations.

Looking forward, the field requires sustained focus on developing affordable, adaptable systems that can reliably operate across diverse agricultural contexts. Priority areas include advancing neural architecture search for task-specific optimization, implementing dynamic fusion algorithms for variable environments, and establishing standardized benchmarks for cross-study comparisons. The ultimate goal remains the development of commercially viable robotic harvesting systems that can enhance productivity while ensuring accessibility across different scales of agricultural operations, from large commercial farms to small-holder farming communities. 

%Robotic fruit picking is advancing toward fully autonomous systems that thrive in varied farm settings. Notwithstanding the persistent challenges posed by occlusion, overcrowded canopies, and scaling costs, the field has witnessed steady advancements in vision and navigation, which hold considerable promise for addressing these issues. In the context of future planning, it is imperative to prioritize the integration of technology that is both affordable and sustainable. This technology should be adaptable to a variety of crops and practices.




%The field of robotic fruit picking is moving towards fully autonomous systems capable of operating in diverse agricultural environments. While significant challenges such as occlusion, dense picking environments, and scalability remain, the continual advancements in vision detection and locomotion technologies are potential. Future research should focus on integrating these technologies into commercially viable solutions, with an emphasis on sustainability and adaptability to different crop types and farming practices. The development of standardized performance metrics and broader collaborative research initiatives could further accelerate the adoption of these technologies in real-world agricultural settings~\cite{lalander2015vermicomposting, mark2019ethics}.
