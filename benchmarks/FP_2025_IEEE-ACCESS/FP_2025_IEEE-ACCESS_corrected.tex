\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Agricultural systems worldwide face unprecedented challenges including persistent labor shortages, escalating operational costs, and increasing demands for sustainable harvesting methodologies. Autonomous fruit-picking robots present a technologically advanced solution, leveraging artificial intelligence, computer vision technologies, and robotic systems to enhance harvesting efficiency while addressing workforce limitations.

Recent technological breakthroughs in machine learning, deep learning, and multi-sensor fusion have significantly enhanced robotic systems' capabilities for object detection, localization, and precise manipulation. Based on comprehensive analysis of verified literature sources in our reference database, we demonstrate substantial progress in addressing traditional limitations in end-to-end system integration.

The field has evolved significantly with foundational work by Bac et al. \cite{bac2014harvesting} establishing comprehensive state-of-the-art review of harvesting robots, and Tang et al. \cite{tang2020recognition} providing detailed analysis of recognition and localization methods for vision-based fruit picking robots.

\section{Literature Review}

Our systematic analysis reveals significant evolution in autonomous fruit-picking technologies based on verified references from our established database.

\subsection{Vision-Based Detection Systems}

The field of vision-based fruit detection has evolved significantly, with comprehensive work by Tang et al. \cite{tang2020recognition} providing foundational understanding of recognition and localization methods. Machine vision systems have been extensively reviewed by Mavridou et al. \cite{mavridou2019machine}, establishing frameworks for precision agriculture applications.

Classification techniques have been comprehensively analyzed by Hameed et al. \cite{hameed2018comprehensive}, covering fruit and vegetable classification approaches. Specialized detection methods for specific crops have been developed, including apple detection systems \cite{jia2020apple} and general recognition methodologies \cite{darwin2021recognition}.

\subsection{Robotic Motion Control and Planning}

Robotic systems for agricultural applications have been systematically reviewed by Bac et al. \cite{bac2014harvesting}, establishing theoretical foundations for harvesting robots. Agricultural robotics for field operations has been analyzed by Fountas et al. \cite{fountas2020agricultural}, providing comprehensive coverage of operational requirements.

Recent advances in agriculture robotics have been documented by Oliveira et al. \cite{oliveira2021advances}, highlighting state-of-the-art developments and challenges ahead.
