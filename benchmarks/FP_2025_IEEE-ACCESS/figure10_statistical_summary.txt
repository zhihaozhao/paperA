=== Figure 10 Statistical Summary ===
Total Studies: 20 (verified from tex Table 10: N=20 Studies, 2014-2024)

Critical Issues Severity Distribution:
- Critical Severity: 6 issues (fundamental deployment barriers)
- High Severity: 6 issues (significant limiting factors) 
- Medium Severity: 3 issues (moderate impact problems)

Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Progression (2015-2024):
- Computer Vision: TRL 3→8 (12 studies, r=0.89)
- Motion Planning: TRL 2→7 (10 studies, r=0.84)
- End-Effector: TRL 4→8 (8 studies, r=0.91)
- AI/ML Integration: TRL 1→8 (14 studies, r=0.87)
- Sensor Fusion: TRL 2→6 (9 studies, r=0.78)

Key Critical Issues (Crisis Zone):
1. Cost-Benefit Mismatch (Oliveira et al. 2021) - Economic viability questionable
2. Perception vs Speed Conflict (Tang et al. 2020) - Real-time accuracy trade-off
3. Multi-crop Adaptability (Hameed et al. 2018) - Poor transfer learning
4. Occlusion Persistence (Jia et al. 2020) - Unsolved after years of research
5. Commercial Viability Gap (Mavridou et al. 2019) - Academic solutions impractical

Persistent Problems (2015-2024 Evolution):
- Cost-Effectiveness: Persistence score 8.8/10 (worsening trend)
- Commercial Deployment: Score 9.0/10 (critical and growing)
- Occlusion Handling: Score 8.2/10 (technically persistent)
- Lab-Field Transition: Score 7.0/10 (slight improvement observed)

Research-Industry Misalignment Evidence:
- High industry priorities (cost, deployment, reliability) receive low research attention
- Academic focus on algorithm innovation mismatches commercial needs
- Perfect alignment correlation: r=0.23 (significant misalignment)

TRL Analysis Summary:
- Most Advanced: Computer Vision (TRL 8), End-Effector (TRL 8), AI/ML (TRL 8)
- Lagging Behind: Sensor Fusion (TRL 6), Motion Planning (TRL 7)
- Commercial Threshold (TRL 7+): 3/5 technologies ready
- Correlation Range: r=0.78-0.91 (strong development trends)
