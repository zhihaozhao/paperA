	abstract={With the advancement of wireless technologies and sensing methodologies, many studies have shown that wireless signals can sense human behaviors. Human activity recognition using channel state information (CSI) in commercial WiFi devices plays an important role in many applications. In this paper, a framework for human activity recognition was constructed based on WiFi CSI signal enhancement. Firstly, the sensitivity of different antennas to human activity was studied. An antenna selection algorithm was proposed, which can make a choice of the antenna automatically based on their sensitivity in accordance with different activities. Secondly, two signal enhancement approaches, which can strengthen the active signals and weaken the inactive signals, were proposed to extract the active interval caused by human activity. Finally, an activity segmentation algorithm was proposed to detect the start and end time of activity. In order to verify and evaluate the methods, extensive experiments have been conducted in real indoor environments. The experimental results have demonstrated that our solutions can eliminate a large number of redundant information brought by insensitive and inactive signals. Our research results can be put into use to improve recognition accuracy significantly and decrease the cost of recognition time.},

	abstract = {WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR) aims to recognize human activities in an off-the-shelf manner that only relies on the commercial Wi-Fi devices already installed in environments. The recent trend in HAR research is to train classifiers on top of statistical or deep neural features extracted from channel state information (CSI) data. Unfortunately, existing methods only take into account the temporal-correlation within each CSI subcarrier, while ignoring the spatial-correlation between different subcarriers. This issue has not been fully exploited yet, resulting a limited performance. To address this issue, we propose WiAReS, a WiFi-based device-free activity recognition system that takes both temporal-correlation and spatial-correlation into account. WiAReS embarks on diversified deep ensemble methods 2̌for single-user activity recognition where one user performs a single activity at a given time. More specifically, it adopts convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract features from CSI measurements with the preservation of the locality of both spatial patterns and temporal patterns. To further improve recognition accuracy upon CNN-extracted features, we propose a novel ensemble architecture that fuses a multiple layer perception (MLP), a random forest (RF) and a support vector machine (SVM). Our system obtains the CSI data in PHY layer of off-the-shelf WiFi devices by installing Atheros-CSI-Tool on AR9590 based WiFi network interface cards (NICs). Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in three real environments with environmental variation to evaluate the performance of the proposed WiAReS. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WiARes system significantly outperforms existing methods.}

	ABSTRACT = {Nowadays, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is being widely used in a variety of domains, and vision and sensor-based data enable cutting-edge technologies to detect, recognize, and monitor human activities. Several reviews and surveys on HAR have already been published, but due to the constantly growing literature, the status of HAR literature needed to be updated. Hence, this review aims to provide insights on the current state of the literature on HAR published since 2018. The ninety-five articles reviewed in this study are classified to highlight application areas, data sources, techniques, and open research challenges in HAR. The majority of existing research appears to have concentrated on daily living activities, followed by user activities based on individual and group-based activities. However, there is little literature on detecting real-time activities such as suspicious activity, surveillance, and healthcare. A major portion of existing studies has used Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) videos and Mobile Sensors data. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are the most prominent techniques in the literature reviewed that are being utilized for the task of HAR. Lastly, the limitations and open challenges that needed to be addressed are discussed.},
