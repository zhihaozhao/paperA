      "title": "Comparing Short-term and Oncologic Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Versus Open Pancreaticoduodenectomy Across Low and High Volume Centers",
      "year": "2019",
      "abstract": "Objective: To compare short-term and oncologic outcomes of patients with cancer who underwent open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) versus minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIPD) using the National Cancer Database. Summary Background Data: MIPD, including laparoscopic and robotic approaches, has continued to gain acceptance despite prior reports of increased short-term mortality when compared with OPD. Methods: Patients with pancreatic cancer diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 undergoing curative intent resection were selected from the National Cancer Database. Patients submitted to OPD were compared with those submitted to MIPD. Laparoscopic and robotic approaches were included in the MIPD cohort. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality; secondary outcomes included 30-day mortality, hospital length of stay, unplanned 30-day readmission, surgical margins, number of lymph nodes harvested, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Propensity score-weighted random effects logistic regression models were used to examine the adjusted association between surgical approach and the specified outcomes. Results: Between 2010 and 2015, 22,013 patients underwent OPD or MIPD for pancreatic cancer and 3754 (17.1%) were performed minimally invasively. On multivariable analysis, there was no difference in 90-day mortality between MIPD and OPD (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75-1.14). Patients undergoing MIPD were less likely to stay in the hospital for a prolonged time (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.68-0.82). 30-day mortality, unplanned readmissions, margins, lymph nodes harvested, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were equivalent between groups. Regardless of surgical approach, patients operated on at high volume centers had reduced 90-day mortality. Conclusion: Patients selected to receive MIPD for cancer have equivalent short-term and oncologic outcomes, when compared with patients who undergo OPD.",

      "year": "2014",
      "abstract": "Background-Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) involves a combination of surgical and percutaneous techniques, which in selected patients may present an alternative to conventional coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods and Results-Patients were included who underwent HCR (staged/concurrent) or isolated CABG in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (July 2011 to March 2013). HCR represented 0.48% (n=950; staged=809, concurrent=141) of the total CABG volume (n=198 622) during the study period, and was performed in onethird of participating centers (n=361). Patients who underwent HCR had higher cardiovascular risk profiles in comparison with patients undergoing CABG. In comparison with CABG, median sternotomy (98.5% for CABG, 61.1% for staged HCR, and 52.5% for concurrent HCR), direct vision harvesting (98.9%, 66.0%, and 68.1%) and cardiopulmonary bypass (83.4%, 45%, and 36.9%) were less frequently used for staged and concurrent HCR, whereas robotic assistance (0.7%, 33.0%, and 30.5%) was more common. After adjustment, no differences were observed for the composite of in-hospital mortality and major morbidity (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.16; P=0.53 for staged HCR, and odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.56; P=0.80 for concurrent HCR in comparison with CABG). There was no statistically significant association between operative mortality and either treatment group (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.30; P=0.29 for staged HCR, and odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-5.17; P=0.053 for concurrent HCR in comparison with CABG). Conclusion-HCR, either as a staged or concurrent procedure, is performed in one-third of US hospitals and is reserved for a highly selected patient population. Although HCR may appear to be an equally safe alternative for CABG surgery, further randomized study is warranted.",

      "year": "2018",
      "abstract": "A kiwifruit detection system for field images was developed based on the deep convolutional neural network, which has a good robustness against the subjectivity and limitation of the features selected artificially. Under different lighting conditions, 2,100 sub-images with 784x784 pixels were prepared by random sub-sampling from 700 field captured images with a pixel resolution of 2352x1568 pixels. Sub-images were used as network training and validation samples. A faster R-CNN was trained end-to-end by using back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent techniques with Zeiler and Fergus network (ZFNet). The average precision of the Faster R-CNN-based kiwifruit detector was 89.3%. Finally, another 100 images of kiwifruit canopies in the field environment (including 5,918 fruits) were used for testing the network. The test results showed that the recognition ratio of occluded fruit, overlapping fruit, adjacent fruit and separated fruit were 82.5%, 85.6%, 94.3% and 96.7%, respectively. Overall, the model reached a recognition rate of 92.3%. The technique took 0.274 s to process each image (for images with 2352x1568 pixels) and only 5.0 ms on average to detect a fruit. Comparing against the conventional methods, it suggested that the proposed method has higher recognition rate and faster speed. Especially, the proposed technique was able to simultaneously detect individual kiwifruit in clusters, which provides a promise for accurate yield mapping and multi-arm robotic harvesting.

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "The development of robotic solutions for agriculture requires advanced perception capabilities that can work reliably in any crop stage. For example, to automatise the tomato harvesting process in greenhouses, the visual perception system needs to detect the tomato in any life cycle stage (flower to the ripe tomato). The state-of-the-art for visual tomato detection focuses mainly on ripe tomato, which has a distinctive colour from the background. This paper contributes with an annotated visual dataset of green and reddish tomatoes. This kind of dataset is uncommon and not available for research purposes. This will enable further developments in edge artificial intelligence for in situ and in real-time visual tomato detection required for the development of harvesting robots. Considering this dataset, five deep learning models were selected, trained and benchmarked to detect green and reddish tomatoes grown in greenhouses. Considering our robotic platform specifications, only the Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and YOLO architectures were considered. The results proved that the system can detect green and reddish tomatoes, even those occluded by leaves. SSD MobileNet v2 had the best performance when compared against SSD Inception v2, SSD ResNet 50, SSD ResNet 101 and YOLOv4 Tiny, reaching an F1-score of 66.15%, an mAP of 51.46% and an inference time of 16.44 ms with the NVIDIA Turing Architecture platform, an NVIDIA Tesla T4, with 12 GB. YOLOv4 Tiny also had impressive results, mainly concerning inferring times of about 5 ms.",

      "abstract": "Background To evaluate the surgical, oncological, and survival outcomes after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with superior mesenteric vein (SMV)/portal vein (PV) resection by either robotic PD (RPD) or open PD (OPD). Methods Data of patients with periampullary lesions undergoing PD were retrieved from a prospectively collected computer database. Surgical risks as well as oncological and survival outcomes were compared between patients with (vein resection group) and without SMV/PV resection (without vein resection group). Results A total of 391 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were enrolled, including 43 (11.0%) and 384 (89.0%) patients with and without vein resection, respectively. Eleven (25.6%) of PDs with vein resection were performed using the robotic approach. Operation time in the vein resection group was significantly longer (median of 8 vs. 7 h). Blood loss, curative resection (R0) rate, and harvested lymph node number were similar between these two groups. Surgical outcomes including postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF), delayed gastric emptying (DGE), postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH), chyle leakage, wound infection, and hospital stay were not significantly different between the two groups. There was no survival difference between these groups, with 1- and 3-year survival rates of 92.6% and 26.5%, respectively, for vein resection group, vs. 70.3% and 37.2%, respectively, for the without vein resection group. Conclusions PD with vein resection is technically feasible by OPD and RPD in selected patients. Additional SMV/PV would not increase the surgical risks of PD and could achieve similar survival outcomes for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma when compared to PD without vein resection.",

      "title": "Automatic Recognition of Ripening Tomatoes by Combining Multi-Feature Fusion with a Bi-Layer Classification Strategy for Harvesting Robots",
      "year": "2019",
      "abstract": "Automatic recognition of ripening tomatoes is a main hurdle precluding the replacement of manual labour by robotic harvesting. In this paper, we present a novel automatic algorithm for recognition of ripening tomatoes using an improved method that combines multiple features, feature analysis and selection, a weighted relevance vector machine (RVM) classifier, and a bi-layer classification strategy. The algorithm operates using a two-layer strategy. The first-layer classification strategy aims to identify tomato-containing regions in images using the colour difference information. The second classification strategy is based on a classifier that is trained on multi-medium features. In our proposed algorithm, to simplify the calculation and to improve the recognition efficiency, the processed images are divided into 9 x 9 pixel blocks, and these blocks, rather than single pixels, are considered as the basic units in the classification task. Six colour-related features, namely the Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Hue (H), Saturation (S) and Intensity (I) components, respectively, colour components, and five textural features (entropy, energy, correlation, inertial moment and local smoothing) were extracted from pixel blocks. Relevant features and their weights were analysed using the iterative RELIEF (I-RELIEF) algorithm. The image blocks were classified into different categories using a weighted RVM classifier based on the selected relevant features. The final results of tomato recognition were determined by combining the block classification results and the bi-layer classification strategy. The algorithm demonstrated the detection accuracy of 94.90% on 120 images, this suggests that the proposed algorithm is effective and suitable for tomato detection",

      "year": "2014",
      "abstract": "Purpose: The aim of this study is to describe our initial experience and assess the feasibility and safety of robotic and laparoscopic lateral pelvic node dissection (LPND) in advanced rectal cancer. Methods: Between November 2007 and November 2012, extended minimally invasive surgery for LPND was performed in 21 selected patients with advanced rectal cancer, including 11 patients who underwent robotic LPND and 10 who underwent laparoscopic LPND. Extended lymphadenectomy was performed when LPN metastasis was suspected on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging even after chemoradiation. Results: All 21 procedures were technically successful without the need for conversion to open surgery. The median operation time was 396 minutes (range, 170-581 minutes) and estimated blood loss was 200 mL (range, 50-700 mL). The median length of stay was 10 days (range, 5-24 days) and time to removal of the urinary catheter was 3 days (range, 1-21 days). The median total number of lymph nodes harvested was 24 (range, 8-43), and total number of lateral pelvic lymph nodes was 7 (range, 2-23). Six patients (28.6%) developed postoperative complications; three with an anastomotic leakages, two with ileus and one patient with chyle leakage. Two patients (9.5%) developed urinary incontinence. There was no mortality within 30 days. During a median follow-up of 14 months, two patients developed lung metastasis and there was no local recurrence. Conclusion: Robotic and laparoscopic LPND is technically feasible and safe. Minimally invasive techniques for LPND in selected patients can be an acceptable alternative to an open LPND.",

      "year": "2019",
      "abstract": "Background: With the rapid development of surgical technics and instruments, more and more locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are being treated by minimally invasive surgery (MIS), including video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS). The aim of this retrospective study was to compare the perioperative and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent lobectomy by these two surgical approaches. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of the prospectively collected database of our hospital to identify patients with clinical stage IIB-IIIA NSCLC who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic or robotic lobectomy. Perioperative outcomes, recurrence, and overall survival (OS) were compared. Results: From January 2014 to January 2017, there were at total of 121 patients, including 36 robotic lobectomy patients and 85 VATS lobectomy patients. One patient (2.8%) in the RATS group and 5 patients (5.9%) in the VATS group were converted to thoracotomy (P=0.79). No perioperative death was observed in both groups. The postoperative morbidity was similar between the two groups (13.9% for RATS vs. 15.3% for VATS; P=0.84). Robotic lobectomy was associated with a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay ( 4 vs. 5 d, P<0.01) and more counts of lymph nodes harvested (13 vs. 10, P<0.01). The median disease-free survival (DFS) for the RATS and VATS groups were 31.1 and 33.8 months, respectively. The corresponding 3-year DFS was 40.3% in the RATS group and 47.6% in the VATS group (P=0.74). The 3-year OS was 75.7% in RATS and 77.0% in the VATS group (P=0.75). Conclusions: For selected NSCLC patients with lymph node involvement, robotic lobectomy is safe and effective with a low complication rate and similar long-term outcome compared with VATS lobectomy. Moreover, the robotic approach resulted in shorter postoperative length of stay and greater lymph node assessment.",

      "abstract": "The detection of cherry tomatoes in greenhouse scene is of great significance for robotic harvesting. This paper states a method based on deep learning for cherry tomatoes detection to reduce the influence of illumination, growth difference, and occlusion. In view of such greenhouse operating environment and accuracy of deep learning, Single Shot multi-box Detector (SSD) was selected because of its excellent anti-interference ability and self-taught from datasets. The first step is to build datasets containing various conditions in greenhouse. According to the characteristics of cherry tomatoes, the image samples with illumination change, images rotation and noise enhancement were used to expand the datasets. Then training datasets were used to train and construct network model. To study the effect of base network and the input size of networks, one contrast experiment was designed on different base networks of VGG16, MobileNet, Inception V2 networks, and the other contrast experiment was conducted on changing the network input image size of 300 pixels by 300 pixels, 512 pixels by 512 pixels. Through the analysis of the experimental results, it is found that the Inception V2 network is the best base network with the average precision of 98.85% in greenhouse environment.

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "Accurate recognition of fruits in the orchard is an important step for robot picking in the natural environment, since many CNN models have a low recognition rate when dealing with irregularly shaped and very dense fruits, such as a grape bunch. It is a new trend to use a transformer structure and apply it to a computer vision domain for image processing. This paper provides Swin Transformer and DETR models to achieve grape bunch detection. Additionally, they are compared with traditional CNN models, such as Faster-RCNN, SSD, and YOLO. In addition, the optimal number of stages for a Swin Transformer through experiments is selected. Furthermore, the latest YOLOX model is also used to make a comparison with the Swin Transformer, and the experimental results show that YOLOX has higher accuracy and better detection effect. The above models are trained under red grape datasets collected under natural light. In addition, the dataset is expanded through image data augmentation to achieve a better training effect. After 200 epochs of training, SwinGD obtained an exciting mAP value of 94% when IoU = 0.5. In case of overexposure, overdarkness, and occlusion, SwinGD can recognize more accurately and robustly compared with other models. At the same time, SwinGD still has a better effect when dealing with dense grape bunches. Furthermore, 100 pictures of grapes containing 655 grape bunches are downloaded from Baidu pictures to detect the effect. The Swin Transformer has an accuracy of 91.5%. In order to verify the universality of SwinGD, we conducted a test under green grape images. The experimental results show that SwinGD has a good effect in practical application. The success of SwinGD provides a new solution for precision harvesting in agriculture.",

      "title": "Robot-assisted versus conventional laparoscopic surgery for endometrial cancer staging: A meta-analysis",
      "year": "2016",
      "abstract": "This meta-analysis broadly compared the safety and efficacy of robot-assisted laparoscopy (RAL) with that of conventional laparoscopy (CL) for endometrial cancer staging. The advantages of RAL were evaluated through the outcomes in terms of conversion rates, complications, length of operation, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, and length of hospitalization. Three electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EmBASE) were searched to identify eligible studies. We selected all retrospective studies documenting a comparison between RAL and CL for endometrial cancer staging between 2005 and 2015, and tallied with meta-analyses criteria. Only studies published in English were included in this analysis. The outcomes of the extracted data were pooled and estimated by the Review Manager version 5.1 software. Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Among the 2105 patients reported, 912 underwent RAL and the other 1193 underwent CL for endometrial cancer staging. Compared with CL, RAL had lower conversion rates [risk ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.25-0.64; p = 0.0002]. Its complications were also less than that of CL (risk ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.94; p = 0.02). RAL was associated with significantly less intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -79.2 mL; 95% CI, from -103.43 to -54.97; p < 0.00001) and a shorter length of hospitalization (weighted mean difference, -0.37 days: 95% CI, from -0.57 to -0.17; p = 0.0003). We found no significant differences in the length of operation and number of lymph nodes harvested between the two groups. From our meta-analysis results, RAL is a safe and effective alternative to CL for endometrial cancer staging. Further studies are required to determine potential advantages or disadvantages of RAL.

      "title": "Automated Detection of Branch Shaking Locations for Robotic Cherry Harvesting Using Machine Vision",
      "year": "2017",
      "abstract": "Automation in cherry harvesting is essential to reduce the demand for seasonal labor for cherry picking and reduce the cost of production. The mechanical shaking of tree branches is one of the widely studied and used techniques for harvesting small tree fruit crops like cherries. To automate the branch shaking operation, different methods of detecting branches and cherries in full foliage canopies of the cherry tree have been developed previously. The next step in this process is the localization of shaking positions in the detected tree branches for mechanical shaking. In this study, a method of locating shaking positions for automated cherry harvesting was developed based on branch and cherry pixel locations determined using RGB images and 3D camera images. First, branch and cherry regions were located in 2D RGB images. Depth information provided by a 3D camera was then mapped on to the RGB images using a standard stereo calibration method. The overall root mean square error in estimating the distance to desired shaking points was 0.064 m. Cherry trees trained in two different canopy architectures, Y-trellis and vertical trellis systems, were used in this study. Harvesting testing was carried out by shaking tree branches at the locations selected by the algorithm. For the Y-trellis system, the maximum fruit removal efficiency of 92.9% was achieved using up to five shaking events per branch. However, maximum fruit removal efficiency for the vertical trellis system was 86.6% with up to four shakings per branch. However, it was found that only three shakings per branch would achieve a fruit removal percentage of 92.3% and 86.4% in Y and vertical trellis systems respectively.",

      "year": "2018",
      "abstract": "The presented work is part of the H2020 project SWEEPER with the overall goal to develop a sweet pepper harvesting robot for use in greenhouses. As part of the solution, visual servoing is used to direct the manipulator towards the fruit. This requires accurate and stable fruit detection based on video images. To segment an image into background and foreground, thresholding techniques are commonly used. The varying illumination conditions in the unstructured greenhouse environment often cause shadows and overexposure. Furthermore, the color of the fruits to be harvested varies over the season. All this makes it sub-optimal to use fixed pre-selected thresholds. In this paper we suggest an adaptive image-dependent thresholding method. A variant of reinforcement learning (RL) is used with a reward function that computes the similarity between the segmented image and the labeled image to give feedback for action selection. The RL-based approach requires less computational resources than exhaustive search, which is used as a benchmark, and results in higher performance compared to a Lipschitzian based optimization approach. The proposed method also requires fewer labeled images compared to other methods. Several exploration-exploitation strategies are compared, and the results indicate that the Decaying Epsilon-Greedy algorithm gives highest performance for this task. The highest performance with the Epsilon-Greedy algorithm (epsilon = 0.7) reached 87% of the performance achieved by exhaustive search, with 50% fewer iterations than the benchmark. The performance increased to 91.5% using Decaying Epsilon-Greedy algorithm, with 73% less number of iterations than the benchmark.",

The system was comprised of three main stages. Firstly, an end-effector and a simple freedom manipulator with three degrees were designed to meet the quality requirements of harvesting Hangzhou White Chrysanthemums. Secondly, a segmentation based on HSV color space was performed. A fast Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm based on S component was proposed to extract the target image from irrelevant background. Thirdly, binocular stereo vision was used to acquire the target spatial information. According to the shape of Hangzhou White Chrysanthemums, the centroids of stamens were selected as feature points to match in the right and left images. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was able to recognize Hangzhou White Chrysanthemums with the accuracy of 85%. When the distance between target and baseline was 150-450 mm, the errors between the calculated and measured distance were less than 14 mm, which could meet the requirements of the localization accuracy of the harvesting robot.",

      "year": "2022",
      "abstract": "Cotton, a major crop worldwide, is harvested in mechanized production systems once at the end of the growing season. To facilitate harvest and maximize fiber quality, the plants are typically defoliated when about 60% of the cotton bolls are open. Due to non-uniform maturation, the bolls that have opened early expose their fiber to weather until harvest, commonly for weeks, degrading fiber quality. Furthermore, high capacity harvesting machines are heavy, potentially compacting the soil that in turn reduces hydraulic conductivity in the wheel tracks and reducing yield. Robotic harvesting with smaller machines brings about the possibility of multiple harvests during the growing season while enabling them to pick the seed cotton soon after the boll opens, preserving fiber quality. Smaller machines would also be less likely to substantially compact the soil. Therefore, research has been conducted to enumerate and address multiple challenges associated with the design of a robotic cotton harvester. The particular focus of the research reported herein was on the design of a robotic end-effector for picking seed cotton from the open boll of a non-defoliated cotton plant. Various design concepts were considered, and some were built as prototypes and experimentally assessed. The design was selected as optimal was: a three-finger, moving pinned belt, underactuated end-effector. A refined prototype of the end-effector was indoor tested on a robotic platform with a computer-controlled three-degree-of-freedom manipulator. The end-effector could pick 66-85% of the seed cotton from a boll with a picking time of 4 s for a simple and less efficient system to 18 s for a controlled-movement and more efficient system. Further implications of this study will include adding a depth sensor on the robot to detect and localize cotton bolls and manipulate arm autonomously.",

      "abstract": "Plastic residues have become a serious environmental problem in areas where agricultural plastic film are used intensively. Although numerous of studies have been done to assess its impacts on soil quality and crop yields, the understanding of meso-plastic particles effects on plant is still limited. In this study, low density polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable plastic (Bio) mulch film were selected to study the effects of meso-plastic debris on soybean germination and plant growth with the accumulation levels of 0%, 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% in soil (w: w, size ranging 0.5¨C2 cm) by a pot experiment under field condition. Results showed that the germination viability of soybean seeds was reduced to 82.39%, 39.44% and 26.06% in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% added plastic debris compared to the control (CK), respectively, suggesting that plastic residues in soil inhibit the viability of soybean seed germination. The plastic debris had a significant negative effect on plant height and culm diameter during the entire growth stage of soybean. Similarly, the leaf area at harvest was reduced by 1.97%, 6.86% and 11.53% compared to the CK in the treatments with 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% plastic debris addition, respectively. In addition, the total plant biomass under plastic addition was reduced in both the flowering and harvesting stages, compared to the CK. For the different type of plastic residues, plant height, leaf area and root/shoot ratio at group PE were significantly lower than those of groups treated by Bio. In conclusion, PE debris had a greater negative effects on plant height, culm diameter, leaf area and root/shoot ratio while Bio debris mainly showed the adverse effects on germination viability and root biomass especially at the flowering stage. Therefore, further research is required to elaborate plastic particles¡¯ effects on different stages of crops and soil quality. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd; Low density polyethylene negatively affected plant height and culm diameter while biodegradable plastic significantly inhibited germination viability and root biomass at the early stage of soybean growth. ? 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

Patients were included who underwent HCR (staged/concurrent) or isolated CABG in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (July 2011 to March 2013). HCR represented 0.48% (n=950; staged=809, concurrent=141) of the total CABG volume (n=198,622) during the study period, and was performed in one-third of participating centers (n=361). Patients who underwent HCR had higher cardiovascular risk profiles in comparison with patients undergoing CABG. In comparison with CABG, median sternotomy (98.5% for CABG, 61.1% for staged HCR, and 52.5% for concurrent HCR), direct vision harvesting (98.9%, 66.0%, and 68.1%) and cardiopulmonary bypass (83.4%, 45%, and 36.9%) were less frequently used for staged and concurrent HCR, whereas robotic assistance (0.7%, 33.0%, and 30.5%) was more common. After adjustment, no differences were observed for the composite of in-hospital mortality and major morbidity (odds ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.16; P=0.53 for staged HCR, and odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.56; P=0.80 for concurrent HCR in comparison with CABG).

HCR, either as a staged or concurrent procedure, is performed in one-third of US hospitals and is reserved for a highly selected patient population.

      "abstract": "Reducing deforestation can generate multiple economic, social and ecological benefits by safeguarding the climate and other ecosystem services provided by forests. Understanding the relative contribution of different drivers of deforestation is needed to guide policies seeking to maintain natural forest cover. We assessed 119 randomly selected plots from areas deforested between 2010 and 2017, in Tanzania. Through ground surveys and stakeholder interviews we assessed the proximate deforestation drivers at each point. Crop cultivation was the most commonly observed driver occurring in 89% of plots, compared to livestock grazing (69%) and charcoal (35%). There was evidence of fire in 77% of plots. Most deforestation events involved multiple drivers, with 83% of plots showing signs of two or more drivers. Stakeholder interviews identified agriculture as the primary deforestation driver in 81% of plots, substantially more than charcoal production (12%), timber harvesting (1%) and livestock (1%). Policy-makers in Tanzania have sought to reduce deforestation by reducing demand for charcoal. However, our work demonstrates that agriculture, not charcoal, is the main driver of deforestation in Tanzania. Beyond protected areas, there is no clear policy limiting the conversion of forests to agricultural land. Reducing deforestation in Tanzania requires greater inter-sectoral coordination between the agriculture, livestock, land, energy and forest sectors. ? 2020 The Author(s).

      "year": "2015",
      "abstract": "For harvesting robot, fruit identification is the key step for accurate fruit positioning and successful picking. The primary task of fruit identification and picking is to separate fruit from complicated background of branches, trunk and sky by image segmentation. It is hard to accurately segment colorized bayberry image because there are fruits with low brightness or uneven illumination in nature scenes. In this study, RGB (red, green and blue) color space was transformed into HSV (hue, saturation and value) space. After that, the luminance component of image was strengthened by dynamic Butterworth homomorphism filter transfer function. Then, it was restored to RGB color space for colorized image illumination compensation and shadow removal. The bayberry image after shadow removal included red bayberry, green leave and white sky. Each pixel of colorized bayberry image to be segmented was considered as one point of data set X. These pixels were classified into red, green and white. According to the characteristics of the components a and b in Lab color space, RGB color space was transformed into CIELAB space. The K-means clustering algorithm was used for image segmentation, and the parameter K was selected as 3. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, 15 bayberry images were selected from 100 images affected by different degrees of shadow under different growth conditions and uneven illumination conditions. Firstly, in order to prove effectiveness of illumination compensation, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to conduct image segmentation experiments before and after illumination compensation to shadow removal. Secondly, in order to validate segmentation effectiveness of images after illumination compensation based on different methods, this study applied adaptive 2*R-G-B grey threshold and K-means clustering segmentation algorithms to compare their effects of shadow removal. Thirdly, homomorphism filter algorithm was compared with linear enhancement and histogram equalization methods, and the K-means algorithm was applied to analyze image segmentation effectiveness based on different strengthen methods. The experiments showed that the segmentation result based on K-means clustering algorithm was without wrong segmentation after illumination compensation for shadow removal compared with that before illumination compensation. Although grey threshold based on color difference 2*R-G-B had better image segmentation effect after illumination compensation, some samples had large wrong segmentation and bright leaves were segmented and classified into bayberry. Therefore, image segmentation by grey threshold based on color difference 2*R-G-B was worse than that segmentation algorithm based on K-means clustering. Three criteria such as segmentation error, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR) were used to evaluate the segmentations results as quantitative analysis. Under the proposed method in this paper, the average segmentation error, FPR and FNR were 3.78%, 0.69% and 6.8%, respectively. Compared with the gray scale transform method, the segmentation error was reduced by 32.94 percent point, FPR by 6.85 percent point and FNR by 29.65 percent point for this proposed method. Then the average segmentation error was reduced by 24.92 percent point compared with the result obtained by histogram equalization method, FPR by 6.12 percent point and FNR by 20.40 percent point. All these results show that image illumination compensation by homomorphism filter algorithm presents better effect of shadow removal. K-means clustering segmentation algorithm has better image segmentation effect after shadow removal.

Many prior studies have demonstrated that soil around the irrigation area is polluted with heavy metals, even though they had not been irrigated by wastewater. In this study, a paddy field downstream of the Zhangshi Irrigation Area was selected as the study area. The Cd concentrations and their representative input and output fluxes to and from the topsoil were systematically studied. The results showed that 95.5% of soil samples exceeded the screening value of Cd concentration. The Cd input fluxes via irrigation water and atmospheric deposition, accounting for 56.95% and 42.53% of the total input flux, respectively, were the main sources of Cd in soil. Crop harvesting was the main output pathway, accounting for 89.63% of the total output flux. An estimation of the annual mass balance showed that Cd in the studied area was in a state of accumulation, and the annual increase in Cd concentration in topsoil would be 2.46 ¦Ìg kg?1 if the observed fluxes remain.

      "year": "2015",
      "abstract": "In order to improve the recognition precision and speed for apple, and further improve the harvesting efficiency of apple harvesting robot, an apple recognition method based on combining K-means clustering segmentation with genetic radial basis function (RBF) neural network is proposed. Firstly, the captured apple image is transformed into L* a* b* color space, and then under this color space, the K-means clustering algorithm is used to segment the apple image. The color feature components and shape components of segmented image are extracted respectively. The color features include R, G, B, H, S and I, a total of 6 feature components; and the shape features include circular variance, density, ratio of perimeter square to area, and 7 Hu invariant moments, a total of 10 shape components. These extracted 16 features are used as the inputs of neural network to train RBF neural network, and get the apple recognition model. Due to some inherent defects the RBF neural network has, such as low learning rate, easily causing over fitting phenomenon, genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced to optimize the connection weights and the number of hidden layer neurons. In this study, a new optimization way is adopted, that is, the hybrid encoding of the number of hidden layer neurons and connection weights is carried out simultaneously. This moment, the learning of weights is not completed, and the least mean square (LMS) is used to further learn the connection weights. Finally, an optimized neural network model (GA-RBF-LMS) is established, which is to improve the operating efficiency and recognition precision. In the experiments, there are 150 images captured, and they have 229 apples; among them 50 images are selected as training samples, and the rest as testing samples. Every image for training sample has only one apple, so the testing samples have 179 apples. In order to get the precise model, fruits of apple are together with branches and leaves for training during the training process, which avoids the influence of branches or leaves shade on the recognition to some extent. So the training samples have 50 apples, 50 branches and 50 leaves, which are a total of 150 training samples, and the outputs of neural network include 3 classes. In order to compare with the traditional back propagation (BP) and RBF neural network, and GA-RBF algorithm, a series of experiments are carried out. After repeated trainings of 50 times, the results show that the successful training rate of the GA-RBF-LMS is the highest, which can reach 100% and get the minimum training error; but its running time is the longest, because the 2 optimizations of genetic algorithm and LMS are at the expense of the time. The recognition rates of the fruits with different growth postures, such as fruit without obscuration, overlapping fruit and covered fruit, are calculated respectively. After repeated experiments of 50 times, the results show that these 4 recognition models can achieve very good effect for recognizing the fruit without obscuration. For covered fruit and overlapping fruit, the recognition rate of GA-RBF-LMS is the highest, which can reach 95. 38% and 96. 17%, respectively. Looking from the overall, the recognition rate reaches 96. 95%, recognizing 179 apples consumes 1. 75 s, and the sum of square of error is the smallest. From the training time, the GA-RBF-LMS algorithm is the longest, whose average training time is 4. 412 s for 150 training samples, but the training success rate can reach 100%, which saves the time wasted in human trying to construct the network structure. All of these illustrate that the GA-RBF-LMS neural network model has the higher operating efficiency and recognition precision, and it can be applied in target recognition for apple harvesting robot. ?, 2015, Nongye Gongcheng Xuebao/Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "An algorithm based on image processing technology was proposed for generating navigation directrix in complex circumstance of short-stalked and close-planting jujube orchard. The hatching method was used to analyze the distribution of target pixels and then proper processing image was obtained. Tree trunk and background were segmented based on B component of image which was binarized by threshold of each scan line. By analyzing the distribution of crossing points between tree truck and ground, the chief processing section, or the region of interest (ROI), was defined and chosen from two-fifths of image area below. Then in the light of trunk longitudinal gray scale distribution, tree trunks location was extracted with gray scale vertical projection method and morphology principle by setting a superficial window to dynamically scan ROI. In order to describe line trend in short-stalked and close-planting jujube orchard, trend lines were introduced, which included the right one and the left one in terms of ridge and furrow. To describe linear distribution trait of ridge and furrow, crossing points between tree and ground were obtained by comparing the shortest distance of candidate point to its corresponding trend line with a man-made threshold value. Afterwards, those selected points were classified separately into 2 clusters in terms of their distribution region which was located at right or left part of image longitudinal symmetry axis, with the point set available to fit the border line of ridge separately. The least square method was used for detecting the right and left border lines, and navigation directrix was generated by extracting the center points between 2 border lines. The method of extracting navigation path was searched by analyzing the condition of short-stalked and close-planting jujube orchard under harvesting operation, and the accuracy and reliability of the algorithm were analyzed and evaluated under a variety of environmental conditions. The study of the algorithm was still in the simulation stage and the specific navigation effect of the algorithm was related to the actual navigation operations, so algorithm performance could not fully represent the actual navigation applications. In order to measure the algorithm reliability and real-time parameters, 5 different scene conditions, which included 4 single factor working conditions and one multiple factor working condition, were tested. The experimental results showed that the algorithm could generate navigation directrix accurately and showed a good noise robustness. Under 4 single factor working conditions, the accuracy was more than 81.3%, and the average processing time consumed was less than 11.9 s to each frame image; by video detection, the accuracy was more than 83.4%, and the average processing time consumed was less than 1.7 s to each frame image. Under multiple factor working condition, the accuracy only reached 45% and the average processing time consumed was 9.4 s; by video detection, the accuracy only reached 42.3% and the average processing time consumed was 1.0 s. Therefore, for subsequent tasks, work should be done to improve the real time performance and practicality of the algorithm for various surroundings, so as to enhance the sensitivity of the algorithm under the multi-mode condition. The novelty of this paper is to propose several new methods to solve practical problems.

The full bearing period of L. barbarum is from May to September every year, which is the picking peak of L. barbarum. It must be picked once about every 7 days. For centuries, the mechanized harvesting of L. barbarum has been a tough problem. Its harvesting has been artificial, which brings about low picking efficiency and high harvesting costs. With the continuous expansion of L. barbarum acreage, fruit picker has been increasingly scarce, which will be followed by rising picking costs. It's no doubt that the picking has become the bottleneck restricting the development of L. barbarum industry. Aiming at realizing the harvesting mechanization of L. barbarum and establishing the theoretical guidance and design basis for the L. barbarum picking machine, the vibration picking mechanism of L. barbarum plant's fruiting branches in picking was studied, the parameter optimization and simulation analysis was done to determine exciting force vector and rotational speed of driving wheel, and an experiment was conducted to prove the obtained rotational speed of driving wheel in this paper. First, we analyzed the working principle of the picking machine to get the vibration picking mechanism. The fruiting branches' model was simplified and the L. barbarum plant's fruiting branches' physical model and mathematical model were got, which were solved by equation solutions. We then obtained the forced vibration response of the fruiting branch and the forced vibration picking inertia force exerted on ripe and unripe fruits and flowers on each node. Second, 10 L. barbarum trees were selected as the test samples. We measured the binding force and mechanical parameters of the L. barbarum and fruiting branches, such as the number of ripe and unripe fruits and flowers, diameter, length, elastic modulus, damping ratio of fruiting branches, and node number. Based on the principle of successful picking which is the ripe can be picked and the other parts wouldn't be picked, the parameters were optimized, and the inertia force changes of the fruits and flowers with rotational speed were simulated with the MATLAB software. Simulation results showed the reasonable rotational speed was 2868.84-2871.21 r/min. Finally, rotational speeds of 7 levels which came from the interval and beyond the interval were selected in the experiment. Using a self-developed experimental L. barbarum picking machine, the test was conducted at planting base of L. barbarum of Ningxia Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, and the fruit distribution before and after picking was compared. Experiment result showed that reasonable rotational speed was 2870 r/min, which is within the reasonable simulation interval of rotational speed. Under this rotational speed, picking efficiency of ripe L. barbarum was 815 grains per minute, the picking rate of ripe fruit was 86.70%, the picking rate of unripe fruit was 7.36%, and the picking rate of flower was 7.43%. The damage rate of fruit was 8.62%. The efficiency ratio of machine to worker was 5.43. Due to the actual picking environment, this result differs from simulation conclusion that the ripe is picked totally and none of the unripe and flowers is picked. The results can provide a reference for the development of L. barbarum vibration picking machines. ?, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.",

      "title": "Feature extraction and classification method of multi-pose pests using machine vision",
      "year": "2014",
      "abstract": "Pest identification and classification is time-consuming work that requires expert knowledge for integrated pest management. Automation, including machine vision combined with pattern recognition, has achieved some applications in areas such as fruit sorting, robotic harvesting, and quality detection, etc. Automatic classification and counting of pests using machine vision is still a challenge because of variable and uncertain poses of trapped pests. Therefore, using Pseudaletia separata, Conogethes punctiferalis, Helicoverpa armigera, Agrotis ypsilon with different poses as research objects, this paper presents a novel classification method for multi-pose pests based on color and texture feature groups and using a multi-class support vector machine. 320 images were taken using field samples with an original resolution of 4 288¡Á2 848. The subimages of pests with 640¡Á640 pixel size were obtained from original images for computational efficiency. Color features in RGB and HSV spaces, statistical texture features, and wavelet-based texture features were extracted. Six feature vector groups were constructed using those features. In order to select effective feature parameters of each group, a genetic algorithm was designed to optimize feature vectors based on 10-fold cross-validation. Finally, the one-against-one DAGMSVM (acronym as yet undefined) algorithm was applied to classify and recognize the four kinds of target pests and to find the best feature group. 80 images (60 for the training set and 20 for the testing set) were adopted for each species. Parameter numbers were calculated and analyzed after optimization, thus the best parameters were selected for each group. The training time of the SVM model and classification accuracy, which contains false negative and false positive details, were compared between pre-optimization and post-optimization. The results showed that the highest parameter optimization ratio is from the sixth feature group with a dimension reduction rate of 61.11%. Compared with the RGB and statistical texture feature group F2, the optimization ratio of HSV and statistical texture feature group F3 is much better; that is, the latter one is more suitable to pest classification. Analysis and comparison between the optimization results of feature group F5 and F6 shows that the latter one is more suitable for multi-pose pest classification. The modeling time of each group has been greatly decreased, especially the one of group F6 (about 8 s), which is the minimum time of all groups with a decreased rate of 74.5%. Average accuracies of all groups have been improved beyond 97%. The sixth group has the highest accuracy (100%). Consequently, the sixth feature group, the feature vector of the wavelet filter in HSV color space, is an effective feature set for use in the classification of multi-pose pests. In addition, we have found that the feature parameters are similar among the misclassification pest sets, which may be improved by increasing the number of sample images in the training set.",

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "High-density dwarf culture has the characters of high yield and easy mechanization, thereby to be expected as a new development direction of the fresh fruit industry. In harvesting, the mechanism of multi-arm cooperation can remarkably improve the operation efficiency of agricultural robots in the orchards of high-density dwarf culture. Generally, multiple picking zone is are established for the collaboration of multi-arm harvesting robots, in order to assign proper picking objects to every manipulator. However, these different zones can be partially overlapped, leading to potential conflicts of manipulators in a robot. Path planning can be utilized to generate a trajectory leading the tip of the manipulator to the goal without collisions. In this study, a global optimization using a Genetic Algorithm(GA) was proposed to solve the planning problem of harvesting tasks with overlapped picking domains in the multi-arm robots toward high-density dwarf orchards. 1) A multi-arm structure without a dead zone in the fruit harvest was specially formulated as a sort of asynchronously multiple traveling salesman problem with overlapped zones. The following mild assumptions were made: a) The visual sensing system can precisely locate the fruits to be harvested; b) The fruits covered by leaves were not considered; c) The exceptional cases during the switching phases from one fruit to another were not considered in the planning stage, meaning that the traveling time linearly depended on the Euclidean distance. Five rules were established for the manipulators to work with better cooperative behaviors in a safe region of the workspace, where no collision occurred. 2)A modified GA was applied to optimize the collision-free trajectory planning of a flexible manipulator, further to ensure operational safety without conflicts in the shortest traveling time. Gene codes were used to formulate various domain-manipulator pairs, thereby determining picking sequences in a manipulator. The total traveling time of travelers was the objective to be optimized, where the population of gene codes was optimized iteratively in the proposed GA. In this case, the critical phases were coding and decoding. The double chromosomes were selected to formulate various picking sequences. After that, three operators were introduced, including selection, crossover, and mutation. The rule of synchronization was designed to avoid different travelers visiting the same cities simultaneously, to cope with the asynchronism in a queuing situation.3) For the three fruit distribution scheme, Once the optimized solution was obtained, the planner can easily achieve the proper sequences for each manipulator to pick fruits via decoding the double chromosomes. As such, each manipulator performed the corresponding task, and the overall picking time was therefore reduced. The test results showedthat:1) The proposed planning converged at 500 and 2 000 iterations, when solving 43 fruits and 90 fruits planning problems with 4 manipulators.2) Compared with the sequential traverse, the modified GA increased the efficiency by 40.9% and 54.98%, when harvesting 43 fruits and 90 fruits, whereas, increased the efficiency by 4.25 times, compared with a single manipulator robot when harvesting 90 fruits.3) compared with the sequential traverse and random traverse, the modified GA increased the efficiency by 110.69% and 27.18%, 20.45% and 23.33%, 12.94%, and 21.69% under three different distributions, respectively. The contributions can be: a) A new planning strategy was proposed for the multi-arm harvester to avoid collisions, where each manipulator behaved cooperatively. b) A novel genetic algorithm was presented, where coding and decoding were first proposed in this field. c) The rule of synchronization was first proposed to deal with the simultaneous visits in the queuing phenomenon during planning. d)A four-arm cooperative harvester was used to verify the effectiveness of the system, where the ergodic picking of each arm can be achieved without conflicts within a minimum duration. The framework can be generalized to many configurations of harvesters, suitable for robots with different numbers of arms, different varieties of fruit, and different ranges of overlapped domains. ? 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "Harvesting of fresh fruit remains heavily reliant on manual labor. It is the most time-consuming and laborious part of the whole fruit production process, which accounts for about 40% of the total workload. Therefore, automatic fruit harvesting technology and agricultural picking robots become a focus of research, and one of the key questions is how to design an end-effector of harvester suitable for specific fruits without damaging fruit during the picking process. A pneumatic sucking-gripping integrated non-destructive end-effector for tomato was developed and a non-destructive control method was proposed in this study. Firstly, an innovative multi-link 3-finger mechanism with spatial envelope was designed, which was arranged symmetrically on a 3-finger type slide guide air gripper and driven by it. The vacuum cup was fixed in the center of three claws and was hinged to claws through multi-linkage. Based on this structure, the degrees of freedom (DOF) of vacuum cup were limited to the axial direction of the air gripper, when three claws opened or closed. Thus, the two motions of pulling and gripping the fruit which was sucked by a vacuum cup were driven by a single active component in order. Secondly, the structural parameters of end effector with a maximum envelope range of 156 mm and the maximum moving distance of sucker 38.7 mm are determined by establishing of kinematic model. Meanwhile, the relative relation between the motion velocity and acceleration of each component was obtained based on ADAMS kinematics and dynamics simulation analysis, as well as the relative relation between the holding force and pneumatic system pressure and fruit size. Thirdly, an electro-pneumatic system of end-effector with pressure feedback and pressure continuous regulation function was built. The Arduino Due programmable controller was used as the controller to control the proportional pressure regulating valve, so that the clamping force can be adjusted continuously in real time. In addition, FSR-402 pressure sensors were placed inside the three gripper fingers to detect the clamping force of each finger in the picking process. By analyzing the time domain signal of the digital quantity of the pressure sensors on the gripper fingers under the two slip conditions of the linear movement and rotation of the fruit relative to the gripper fingers, the dual-threshold slip judgment algorithm based on dynamic standard deviation rising fluctuation node and non-destructive picking control strategy based on slippage criterion and threshold of damage limit pressure were presented. Finally, the actuator performance test was carried out in the vegetable planting base of Bishan District, Chongqing, China. 204 ripe tomatoes of Hongyun 712 cultivar with an outer diameter from 50 to 100 mm were selected for field trials. The indexes of picking success rate were defined to evaluate the performance of the end-effector. The direct damage rate and a 72 h browning rate were used to measure the performance of non-destructive clamping control method. The experimental results showed that the picking success rate was 96.03% of this actuator, direct damage rate was 1.58%, 72 h browning rate was 1.76%, and time consuming of one picking process was 5 s, which demonstrated the picking end-effector could sufficiently meet the usage demand of fruit picking robot. ? 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "Tomato picking environment is characterized by an unstructured space covering most obstacles, such as branches and vines. It is difficult to accurately express in a regular way, particularly for the relatively large volume of tomato bunches. Therefore, the motion planning of the robotic arm in a harvesting manipulator needs to consider how to pick tomato bunches, while avoiding obstacles after cutting the tomato bunches, and finally extracting them from a complex actual environment. Most previous motion planning of tomato picking focused mainly on the obstacle-free moving to the position of picking stalk. But only a few studies reported the specific fruit extraction with an increase in volume after the end-effector of robotic arm gripping the tomato bunch. Taking the tomato bunch picking cultivated in the greenhouse as the research object, real-time motion planning with collision-free Optimal Picking Space (OPS) was proposed here using space segmentation. A reasonable and effective space was also selected for the robotic arm to implement the picking task, in advance to avoid the failure caused by fruit collision or beyond the working range of the manipulator. The specific procedure was as follows. 1) Thousands of color pictures with tomato bunches were first collected. The YOLO-V3 model was used for training to obtain a better recognition network. An RGB-D camera was then used to capture the color and depth information of the environment. The trained YOLO-V3 model was to identify and locate the pixel position of the picking point for the tomato strings in the color map. Next, the internal and external parameters of the camera were cooperated to determine the three-dimensional position of the picking point for a tomato string. An improved density clustering was utilized to focus on the picking area near the picking point of the tomato bunch, while separate the multiple obstacles in the environment. A polynomial function was selected to fit the space curve of branch obstacles falling from top to bottom during the tomato cluster picking in an actual situation. The picking space was divided into multiple sub-spaces, according to the relative positions of branch obstacles and picking points. These sub-spaces, therefore, served as the basis to select the optimal picking space. 2) The volume of each sub-space was calculated to accommodate tomato bunches, while filter out the invalid narrow subspace. Correspondingly, a feasible configuration of the robot arm was achieved in a set of effective subspace, including the unfiltered subspaces, where the invalid subspace outside the working range was filtered out. An evaluation function was also formulated to comprehensively consider the path length and operational space of the robot arm in the joint space. Therefore, an optimal picking subspace was selected from the remaining effective subspaces via the evaluation function. 3) The optimal picking subspace was used as the guidance space of the path plan for the robot arm. Sensing and execution points were then set for the robot arm. Real-time obstacle-free factors were added into the motion planning of the robot arm. As such, the robot arm rapidly switched the modes between obstacle avoidance and attitude adjustment. Therefore, OPS was selected to guide the robotic arm for the real-time, obstacle-free, and non-destructive harvesting of tomato bunches. The optimal picking space greatly contributed to the highly efficient action of a manipulator. The average picking time of single bunch tomatoes using OPS simulation was 12.51s, reduced by 31.23% compared with the current mainstream RRT*-connect, while reduced by 53.23% compared with the Lazy-PRM*, and 19.29% reduction compared with the manual picking. The number of nodes in the OPS path was also reduced, compared with the random expansion node RRT*-connect and Lazy-PRM*. The success rate of motion planning was close to 100%, indicating a high-precision, real-time and rapid intelligent picking. ? 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "With development and wide application of modern information technology as presented by the Internet of things, the position monitoring of operation process of agricultural machinery has been realized easily. But the existing remote monitoring system for agricultural machinery has only realized the remote storage, display and simple analysis. It is difficult to meet the requirements of fine management and intelligent data processing of agricultural machinery. In this paper, combining with the characteristics of the space track of agricultural machinery, the methods of clustering in data mining and spatial data analysis method were used to study automatic segmentation algorithm of field operation area based on spatial track of agricultural machinery. The procedure is as follows: firstly, data preprocessing, including velocity threshold and projection transformation methods, is preparing for further gridding and density slicing for the next step; secondly, spatial track of agricultural machinery was gridded; thirdly, density slicing removed low density cell-grids and preserved high density cell-grids; fourthly, spatial partition tree and spatial index are constructed, which is able to accelerating query speed of spatial nearest neighbors; finally, the cluster analysis is executed to connect high density cell-grids adjacently. The automatic identification of typical agricultural machinery operation method was designed and achieved. The quantitative analysis of the agricultural machinery operation divisions within the field operation time, transfer time and idle time of the agricultural machinery operation were divided and analyzed quantitatively. From May 27, 2012 to June 20, 2012, which is the season of wheat harvest, in order to verify the state of agricultural machinery operation cut automatic identification algorithm, the agricultural machinery tests were carried out in the Shijia Agricultural Machinery Cooperation in Xuchang City, Henan Province. Nine wheat harvesters, installing the embedded vehicle terminal based on GPS (positioning accuracy: 10 m, velocity measurement precision: 0.1 m/s) and GPRS (general packet radio service), were selected to do real harvesting task to produce spatial track data of agricultural machinery. The data collected by embedded vehicle terminal was used to verify the state of agricultural machinery operation cut automatic identification algorithm above. It showed that the accuracy of clustering algorithm based on spatial index and density slicing was above 89% in agricultural machinery test. After comparing clustering algorithm used in this paper with K-Means clustering algorithm and DBSCAN clustering algorithm, it is found that the clustering algorithm used in this paper has the best time efficiency, and the K-Means algorithm is better, and the DBSCAN algorithm has the worst run-time efficiency. It is shown that the construction of spatial partition tree and spatial index is very effective to accelerating query speed of spatial nearest neighbors, so it improves the clustering algorithm efficiency. But the current algorithm model is sensitive to the parameters of grid size and density threshold. The parameter setting depends on statistical analysis of spatial track of agricultural machinery. The grid size and density threshold are closely related to equipment width, working speed of agricultural machinery, and the frequency of GPS data uploading. The study direction in future is how to establish the quantitative relationship among the above parameters. ?, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All right reserved.",

An effective way can be to optimize the row space, thereby to achieve the integration of agricultural machinery and agronomy for machine-harvested cotton. In this study, two machine-harvested cotton patterns were selected, including the \"aimizao\" planting pattern (six lines per film with wide-narrow row spacing, 66+10 cm), and the \"kuanzaoyou\" planting pattern (three lines per film with equal row spacing, 76 cm) in 2018-2019, as well as 3 planting densities of 135 000, 180 000 and 225 000 plants/hm2. The dynamic changes of soil temperature and soil moisture were monitored during the whole cotton growth period, and the water use efficiency was analyzed combined with the cotton yield, in order to compressively evaluate the applicability of different machine-harvested cotton pattern. The results showed that different machine-harvested cotton patterns and planting densities can affect the soil temperature, but there was no interaction effect. The variation characteristics of soil temperature were consistent under different treatments. With the increase of atmospheric temperature, soil temperature increased, but decreased rapidly and fluctuated after the cotton ridges were closed. There was no significant difference in soil temperature of plough layer under different planting patterns and planting densities in the early growth stage (May to June). However, the soil temperature in flowering and boll setting stage increased by the \"kuanzaoyou\" planting pattern, where 1.7 ¡æ on average higher than that of \"aimizao\" planting pattern. The accumulated soil temperature of plough layer in the whole growth period under the \"kuanzaoyou\" pattern significantly increased by 8.3%-9.9% (P<0.05), compared with that of the \"aimizao\" pattern. In the water consumption during the whole growth period, the water consumption in the \"kuanzaoyou\" pattern was lower than that of the \"aimizao\" pattern, but the difference was not significant. Increasing planting density can reduce the accumulated temperature of plough layer, but increase the water consumption of the cotton field. Compared with the \"aimizao\" planting pattern in 2019, the \"kuanzaoyou\" planting pattern significantly increased the yield and water use efficiency by 17.5% and 18.8% (P<0.05), respectively. It infers that the \"kuanzaoyou\" pattern can be used to improve the soil hydrothermal conditions of cotton growth, and thereby to achieve a significant increase in yield and water use efficiency.

      "title": "Method of haze-removal based on dark channel prior in visual system of apple harvest robot",
      "year": "2016",
      "abstract": "It is difficult to locate the apple in fog and haze environment for apple harvest robot. This paper proposed a new method to apply the principle of DCP (dark channel prior) to remove fog and haze on images which were collected from apple orchard. We adopted a new route to achieve the value of atmospheric light coefficient. Scan the hazed image with a 15¡Á15 window, and get the smallest value of the 225 pixels from every window. All the smallest values constituted a dark channel image. The values of dark channel were stored in a matrix at the first step, and then the 1/1000 largest elements and their locations were calculated and stored in a new matrix which had the same shape with the dark channel matrix. Extract the matrix of red (R) channel of the hazed image at the next step. At the third step, the corresponding values in the matrix of R channel were obtained according to the position information in the new matrix. Finally, the average value of these values was calculated as the value of atmospheric light coefficient. According to the requirement of apple harvest robot, we took the haze-removal strength parameter of DCP algorithm as 1. In order to speed up the running of the algorithm, we calculated the transmission radio with guided filter. Image segmentation method used in the study had 3 stages: binaryzation, de-noising and dilation. Firstly, the grey image was obtained by calculating a special linear combination with red (R) channel, green (G) channel and blue (B) channel. This method emphasized the value of red channel in color images, which was conducive to separate the apple better at the next step. Secondly, binary image was obtained by Otsu method based on the grey image. Finally, after the process of de-noising and dilation, a better segmentation results could be obtained. We developed an experimental software with Microsoft Vision Studio 2010 and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) to test the haze-removal effects in apple harvest robot vision system. The graphical user interface of the program was developed based on MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) library. The software had achieved the following functions: reading the image, calculating the dark channel value, calculating the value of atmospheric light coefficient based on the R channel, calculating the transmission radio, and so on. Based on this software we compared some haze-removal methods including MSR (multiscale retinex), AHE (adaptive histogram equalization) and DCP with different parameters. Hardware platform of the experiment was X230, which is a notebook computer produced by Lenovo Inc. We took Nikon D7100 camera as the image acquisition equipment and fixed it with tripod when it worked. Experimental images were collected at the apple base in Changping District of Beijing. Image acquisition dates were some days with heavy fog and haze in November 2015. Twelve images were selected as the experimental materials.

      "abstract": "Apple harvesting is a highly seasonal and labor-intensive activity in modern agriculture. Fortunately, a harvesting robot is of great significance to improve the productivity and quality of apples, further alleviating the labor shortage in orchards. Among them, the detection model of the harvesting robot is also required to accurately and rapidly detect the target apples in the complex and changing orchard environment. It is a high demand for the small size to be deployed in the embedded device. This study aims to improve the speed and comprehensive performance of apple detection in a complex orchard environment. A Lightweight apple detection YOLOX-Tiny Network (Lad-YXNet) model was proposed to reduce the size of the original model. Some images of ¡°Yanfu¡± and ¡°Micui¡± apples were obtained during the apple harvest season in 2021. The images were uniformly clipped to the 1024¡Á1024 pixels. As such, 1 200 images were selected to make the dataset, including the fruits with shaded branches and leaves, fruit clusters, varying degrees of illumination, blurred motion, and high density. This model was then used to optimize the topology of the single-stage detection network YOLOX-Tiny. Two lightweight visual attention modules were added to the model, including Efficient Channel Attention (ECA), and Shuffle Attention (SA). The Shuffle attention and double convolution layer (SDCLayer) was constructed to extract the background and fruit features. Swish and Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky-ReLU) was identified as the activation functions for the backbone and feature fusion network. A series of ablation experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of Mosaic enhancement in the model training. The average precision of the Lad-YXNet model decreased by 0.89 percent and 3.81 percent, respectively, after removing random image flipping and random image length width distortion. The F1-socre also decreased by 0.91 percent and 1.95 percent, respectively, where the precision decreased by 2.21 percent and 2.99 percent, respectively. There was a similar regularity of the YOLOX-Tiny model. After removing the image random combination, the average precision of the Lad-YXNet and the YOLOX-Tiny model decreased by 0.56 percent and 0.07 percent, the F1-socre decreased by 0.68 percent and 1.15 percent, as well as the recall rate decreased by 2.35 percent and 4.49 percent, respectively. The results showed that the random distortion of image length and width greatly contributed to the performance of model detection. But the random color gamut transformation of the image decreased the performance of model detection, due to the change of apple color in the training set. Two specific tests were conducted to explore the effectiveness of visual attention mechanisms in convolution networks. Specifically, one was to remove the visual attention modules from the Lad-YXNet, and another was to exchange the position of visual attention modules from the Lad-YXNet. Compared with the Lad-YXNet, the precision of the improved model to exchange the position of the visual attention modules only increased by 0.04 percent, while the recall, F1-socre, and average precision decreased by 0.78 percent, 0.39 percent, and 0.13 percent, respectively. The precision, recall, F1-socre, and average precision of the models without the attention module were reduced by 1.15 percent, 0.64 percent, 0.89 percent, and 0.46 percent, respectively, compared with the Lad-YXNet. Consequently, the SA and ECA enhanced the ability of the Lad-YXNet to extract the apple features, in order to improve the comprehensive detection accuracy of the model. The main feature maps of Lad-YXNet's backbone, feature fusion, and detection network were extracted by the feature visualization technology. A systematic investigation was made to determine the process of detecting apples with the Lad-YXNet in the complex natural environment, particularly from the point of feature extraction. As such, improved interpretability was achieved in the apple detection with the Lad-YXNet model. The Lad-YXNet was trained to be an average accuracy of 94.88% in the test set, which was 3.10 percent, 2.02 percent, 2.00 percent, and 0.51 percent higher than SSD, YOLOV4-Tiny, YOLOV5-Lite, and YOLOX-Tiny models, respectively. The detection time of an image was achieved in 10.06 ms with a model size of 16.6 MB, which was 20.03% and 18.23% less than YOLOX-Tiny, respectively. Therefore, the Lad-YXNet was well balanced with the size, precision, and speed of the apple detection model. The finding can provide a theoretical basis to accurately and quickly detect the apples for the harvesting robot in the complex orchard environment. ? 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "Tapping is the key technical procedure for the extraction of the latex from rubber trees in the processing of natural rubber. However, there are some problems with current fixed rubber-tapping equipment, such as high production cost, high weight of the whole machine, and low tapping precision. In this study, a new fixed tapping robot was designed using advanced polymer materials. The tapping robot was mainly composed of the clamping mechanism, tapping table, combined roller screw pair, and the module of measuring limits. The weight of the main body in a robot was reduced, thereby making it easier to assemble than before. It is conducive to mass processing and production of tapping robots made of polymer materials, due mainly to the processing cost was also reduced. Specifically, the clamping component was utilized to hold on the tree trunk, when the tapping robot was attached to the rubber tree within the rubber cutting cycle. A tapping control system was selected to scan the tree rounds before tapping. In processing, the eccentric load can cause the bending behavior of the rubber trunk between the tapping robot and the tree trunk. A circumferential motor and an axial motor were set to control the trajectory of the cutter. The running speed of the two motors was controlled to move at a certain ratio during the cutting process, where the spiral secant in space was formed from the bottom right to the top left around the rubber tree. An ultrasonic sensor was used to scan the tree rounds, thereby determining the distance between the ultrasonic sensor and rubber trunk. A mathematical model of error predictive control was established to obtain the distance between the tip of the cutter and the bark. A PID control was also selected to control the cutter feed, thereby reducing the cutting error in rubber tapping. The range of cutting depth was determined, according to the structure of rubber bark, and the relevant technical regulations for tapping. The fixed cutting depth of 5.5 mm was expanded to the range of 5.2 to 5.8 mm, to reduce the counting of the cutter moving forward and backward, while reducing the power loss of the motors. Taking the rubber tree with the trunk diameter of 180 mm as a research material, a rubber cutting test was conducted to verify the simulation data, where the cutting helix angle was set as 25¡ã-30¡ã in tapping. The results showed that the cutter tip of a tapping robot was guaranteed to reach the target position through the control system. The tapping work was completed by one pass, where the effective cutting time was only 22 s. The tapping efficiency of a fixed tapping robot increased by 63%, compared with traditional manual tapping, where usually multiple passes were required and the effective cutting time was 1 min. The fixed tapping robot achieved a fast and accurate tapping. The bark consumption of cutting rubber was 1.1 mm, indicating suitable for the requirement of bark consumption in the technical specification of tapping. The counting of the cutter moving forward and backward was 36%, lower than that of the original scheme during tapping within the range of 5.2-5.8 mm cutting depth, and the maximum variation range of cutter current was reduced by 4.11%. The rubber tree was not damaged using the fixed tapping robot and tapping control. The fixed tapping robot can be expected to completely replace the manual tapping, and further widely popularize due to its reduced motor power, and improved tapping efficiency. ? 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Conventional testing is time-consuming and laborious, thus not to be implemented over vast areas and to enable the estimation of future changes for revealing optimal harvesting. Images of single panicles were shot with smartphones and corrected using a spectral¨Cgeometric correction board. In total, 86 panicle samples were obtained each time and then dried at 80 ¡ãC for 7 days to acquire the wet-basis GMC. In total, 517 valid samples were obtained, in which 80% was randomly used for training and 20% was used for testing to construct the image-based GMC assessment model. In total, 17 GMC surveys from a total of 201 samples were also performed from an area of 1 m2 representing on-site GMC, which enabled a multi-day GMC prediction. Eight color indices were selected using principal component analysis for building four machine learning models, including random forest, multilayer perceptron, support vector regression (SVR), and multivariate linear regression. The SVR model with a MAE of 1.23% was the most suitable for GMC of less than 40%.

      "title": "Parameters' optimization and verification for processing tomato fruit-seedling separation",
      "year": "2015",
      "abstract": "In order to meet the needs of localization in China about the self-propelled tomato harvester, two methods of CCD (central composite design) and RSM (response surface methodology) were employed to optimize the performance of fruit-seedling separation. The testing device of fruit-seedling separation was consisted of wiggler (including eccentric block, exciter and timing belt pulleys), separation roller, separation tine and damper components. Rotary motion from the power source was turned into a variable speed rotary motion by the eccentric drive mechanism of the wiggler, and passed to the separation roller to achieve the fruit-seedling separation through its periodic oscillations. When the testing device worked, tomato plants were transported to the fruit-seedling separation device by the conveying chain and got the separation of fruit and vine. The processing tomatoes were sent to picking boxes through conveying chain after being separated. The velocity of conveying chain and the wiggler speed could be adjusted through the transducer-controlled drive motor. The harvesting productivity was controlled by the amount of tomato plants fed and the separation time in the separation roller. The determination and calculation of fruit-seedling separation rate and fruit damage rate was based on the reference to the tomato harvester work quality standards (NYT 1824-2009). The productivity, wiggler speed and chain velocity were taken as 3 independent variables and fruit-seedling separation rate and fruit damage rate were the responsive variables. The relationship between these 3 variables and 2 responsive variables was explored by the RSM. The mathematical regression model was established by using the CCD method and the influencing rules of the factors were explored. The experimental parameters were optimized by using the Design Expert 9.0 software. The optimal combination of separation parameters was determined, under the condition that the tomato separation rate and tomato damage rate both met the quality standard for tomato harvester (NYT1824-2009). The result showed that, in terms of significant degree, the influence factors of separation rate were the wiggler speed, the productivity and the chain velocity, respectively, and the influence factors of damage rate were the wiggler speed, the chain velocity and the productivity, respectively. The optimal combination of parameters was 34.2 t/h of the productivity, 409.3 r/min of the wiggler speed and 0.71 m/s of the chain velocity. The rates of tomato separation and damage predicted by the models were 96.27% and 2.12%, respectively. The model validation tests had been repeated for 5 times on processing tomato fruit-seedling separation device by using the optimization results in the laboratory of agricultural machinery of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Both of the relative errors between the experimental and predicted values of fruit-seedling separation rate and fruit damage rate were less than 5%, which indicated a reasonable choice of optimization conditions. Predicted value of fruit-seedling separation rate was 96.27%, which was greater than 95.5%, and predicted value of tomato damage rate was 2.12%, which was less than 5%. It met the threshold limit values of 95.5% and 5% about operating quality for tomato harvester (NYT1824-2009). Therefore, the prediction model of separation performance established was appropriate and the optimization separation parameters obtained were also feasible. The test was based on double eccentric vibration generator device and only Riegel 87-5 was selected as the testing object. Further study on fruit-seedling separation properties under different kinds of processing tomatoes and different types of vibration generators was recommended. This study showed that fruit-seedling separation parameters obtained by the RSM were feasible, which might provide a theoretical basis for further research of fruit-seedling vibration separation technology of processing tomato. ?, 2015, Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "year": "2021",
      "abstract": "Efficient detection of grape image has widely been one of the most important technologies in automatic grape harvesting robots. In this study, a wine grape detection model (WGDM) was proposed to improve the speed and accuracy of field grape detection using a lightweight network. Firstly, the MobileNetV2 lightweight network was adopted to significantly increase the detection speed for real-time objects in the WGDM model, due to the smaller size, faster speed, and higher accuracy in the image recognition, compared with DarkNet53 in the original YOLOv3. Secondly, the M-Res2Net module was added to the multi-scale detection of YOLOv3, as some standard convolutional layers with 1¡Á1 and 3¡Á3 convolution kernels were removed, particularly for the better capability of multi-scale feature extraction and higher accuracy of detection in the improved model. Finally, a new location loss function was established using the balanced loss and the intersection over union loss. The classification and object loss stayed the same as the YOLO. As such, a more balance was achieved in the object, classification and location during the model training, thereby to enlarge the precision of object location. Different detection models were trained, including the proposed WGDM, Single Shot Detector (SSD), the original YOLOv3, YOLOv4, and Faster Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). The available wine grape instance segmentation dataset (WGISD) was also selected, including 300 images of wine grape and 300 annotation files with 4 432 objects under the same experimental conditions. Additionally, the resolution of input image was adjusted from the original resolution of 2 048¡Á1 365 pixels or 2 048¡Á1 536 pixels to 608¡Á608 pixels. The experimental results showed that the proposed WGDM model in the test set of wine grape image dataset achieved an average accuracy of 81.20%. The F1-score (a metric function that balances the precision and recall of the model) of the proposed model reached 0.856 3, which was 0.056 3 higher than that of SSD, 0.005 4 higher than that of the original YOLOv3, 0.041 7 higher than that of YOLOv4, and 0.012 5 higher than that of Faster R-CNN. The network structure size of the proposed model was 44 MB, which was 50 MB smaller than that of SSD, 191 MB smaller than that of the original YOLOv3 or YOLOv4, and 83 MB less than that of Faster R-CNN. The average detection time for each grape image in the proposed model was 6.29 ms, which was 4.91 ms shorter than that of SSD, 7.75 ms shorter than that of the original YOLOv3, 14.84 ms shorter than that of YOLOv4, and 158.2 ms shorter than that of Faster R-CNN. Moreover, the number of floating-point operations (the sum of the number of multiplication operations and the number of addition operations) of the proposed model was only 10.14 ¡Á109, which was 11.58% of SSD 14.54% of the original YOLOv3, 16.05% of YOLOv4, and 5.48%-15.33% of Faster R-CNN. Therefore, the proposed WGDM model presented the faster and more accurate recognition and location of grape fruits in the field, providing a feasible path for the efficient visual detection of grape picking robots. ? 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "Mechanical harvesting can significantly improve the technical efficiency, while reduce the production cost in maize farming. However, the evaluation system and maize variety are still lacking, particularly suitable for mechanical grain harvesting in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China. Variety selection of maize has also limited the implementation of mechanical grain harvesting in modern agriculture. In this study, a 3-year experiment on the variety/density of spring maize, and 2-year experiment on mechanical grain harvesting were carried out in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China. Three first-level evaluation indexes were set, including the suitability for mechanical grain harvesting, high-stable yield while high quality, and high Water Use Efficiency (WUE), according to the requirements of varieties, climate, and planting conditions in the mechanical grain harvesting for this region. The second-level evaluation indexes under the suitability for mechanical grain harvesting were the broken rate of kernel, impurity rate, and total loss rate. The relationship between the broken rate of kernel and impurity rate with the moisture content of kernel were in the parabolic and exponential form, respectively. The moisture contents of kernel were 3.6%~24.8% and ¡Ü26.99%, when the broken rate of kernel ¡Ü5% and impurity rate ¡Ü3%. Therefore, the third-level evaluation indexes under the kernel broken rate and impurity rate was the moisture content of kernel at the 10th day after physiological maturity, where the criteria was ¡Ü25%. The total loss rate represented the parabolic relationship with the moisture content of kernel, and the linear relationship with the lodging rate and standard deviation of ear height. Therefore, the third-level evaluation indexes under the total loss rate were the moisture content of kernel at the 10th day after physiological maturity(¡Ü25%), lodging rate(¡Ü5%), and standard deviation of ear height(¡Ü5.93 cm). In 3-year experiment on the variety/density of spring maize, the average yield, WUE and ear rot rate were 10 889.64 kg/hm2, 2.28 kg/m3 and 1.75%, respectively. The average standard deviation of yield and WUE were 1 776.79 kg/hm2 and 0.43 kg/m3, respectively. The high and stable coefficient of yield and WUE were 0.53 and 0.46, respectively. According to the correlation analysis, the increasing ratio of yield and WUE with the density increasing by 15 000 plants/hm2 were 6.59% and 11.89%, whereas, the decreasing ratio of yield per plant with the density increasing by 15 000 plants/hm2 was 8.38. These values of yield, ear rot rate, and WUE can be used to set the second-level evaluation indexes under the high-stable yield while high quality, and high-stable WUE. The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) and entropy weight method were selected to calculate the comprehensive weights of each evaluation index. The discrimination criteria of evaluation index can be used as the index values of distinguish variety, to avoid relying solely on sequencing for the selection of maize varieties. In 2-year experiment on mechanical harvest, Yufeng 98, Yudan 9953, and Jinkeyu 3306 were selected as spring maize varieties, due to their fast grain dry down rate, high and stable yield, increasing yield with high density, low ear rot rate, and high WUE. The evaluation system of suitable variety can contribute to the promotion of mechanical maize harvesting in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, providing for a certain reference for the selection of high-yield maize varieties suitable for high-density planting, and mechanical harvesting in other areas. ? 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "Accurate road extraction and recognition of roadside fruit in complex orchard environments are essential prerequisites for robotic fruit picking and walking behavioral decisions. In this study, a novel algorithm was proposed for unstructured road extraction and roadside fruit synchronous recognition, with wine grapes and nonstructural orchards as research objects. Initially, a preprocessing method tailored to field orchards was proposed to reduce the interference of adverse factors in the operating environment. The preprocessing method contained 4 parts: interception of regions of interest, bilateral filter, logarithmic space transformation and image enhancement based on the MSRCR algorithm. Subsequently, the analysis of the enhanced image enabled the optimization of the gray factor, and a road region extraction method based on dual-space fusion was proposed by color channel enhancement and gray factor optimization. Furthermore, the YOLO model suitable for grape cluster recognition in the wild environment was selected, and its parameters were optimized to enhance the recognition performance of the model for randomly distributed grapes. Finally, a fusion recognition framework was innovatively established, wherein the road extraction result was taken as input, and the optimized parameter YOLO model was utilized to identify roadside fruits, thus realizing synchronous road extraction and roadside fruit detection. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method based on the pretreatment could reduce the impact of interfering factors in complex orchard environments and enhance the quality of road extraction. Using the optimized YOLOv7 model, the precision, recall, mAP, and F1-score for roadside fruit cluster detection were 88.9%, 89.7%, 93.4%, and 89.3%, respectively, all of which were higher than those of the YOLOv5 model and were more suitable for roadside grape recognition. Compared to the identification results obtained by the grape detection algorithm alone, the proposed synchronous algorithm increased the number of fruit identifications by 23.84% and the detection speed by 14.33%.

      "year": "2020",
      "abstract": "Vibration energy harvesting systems can convert the vibrational energy into the useful electric power, thereby offer a promising source of renewable energy for sustainable development of a society. However, there remains a great challenge on high power density and broadband energy collection under random power spectrum. In this study, a high power-density and broadband Magnetic-Floating Energy Harvester (MFEH) was presented for diverse vibration excitations. A COMSOL Multiphysics software was used to calculate the relationship between magnetic restoring force and displacement during the vibration. A mathematical model was established to explore the effects of different parameters on the performance of energy harvester, according to the governing equations of magnetic-floating vibration system and Kirchoff's law. The simulation results show that the maximum output voltage varied slightly from 16 to 22 V, as the mass of levitated magnet increased, indicating that the variation in mass can pose some influence on the maximum output voltage. Nevertheless, the resonant frequency decreased, when the mass of levitated magnet increased. The excitation acceleration has a significant influence on the maximum output voltage, whereas, there was a relatively small increase in the resonant frequency. Specifically, the spacing, d0, has a significant impact on the curve shape of output voltage. There was only a unique solution for the governing equation, when the values of d0 were 53 and 52 mm, respectively, where the curves of output voltage were stable. But the solution for the governing equation was not unique, when the d0 was less than 52 mm. Consequently, the curve included the stable and unstable solutions, indicating that the jump phenomenon occurred in this case. Analogous to the parameter spacing d0, the damping ratio also strongly determined the curve shape. When the damping ratio was less than 0.21, the curve also included the stable and unstable solution in presence of the jump phenomenon. Diverse excitation conditions, such as the sinusoidal sweeping and fixed frequency vibration, were selected to verify the capacity of power generation. Subsequently, the performance of energy harvester was evaluated by the indexes of efficiency, effectiveness, and the volume figure of merit. A regulated power supply circuit was also designed, combined with the practical application. A mathematical model of random excitation was established, according to the spectrum characteristics for a random road, when an agricultural machine working on hilly and mountainous areas. The solution of stationary probability density was obtained using the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FFK) equation expression for the response amplitude of probability density function. Experimental results showed the maximum output voltage ranged from 5.92 to 21.52 V, as the excitation frequency varied from 9.77 to 31.75 Hz under diverse amplitude. The maximum power reached 81.93 mW at 10 Hz. From 5 Hz to 50 Hz, the maximum deliverable power is 81.93 mW. The efficiency, effectiveness, and the volume figure of merit for the designed energy harvester were 2.85%, 9.85% and 39.74%, respectively. Five peaks can be obtained for the power spectral density of output generating voltage in energy harvester, where the frequencies were 9.80, 29.41, 36.76, 36.76, 51.47, and 71.08 Hz, indicating a broadband power response. The proposed device can be applied for powering the most sensors of agricultural machinery and equipment in hilly and mountainous areas. ? 2020, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a rule-based methodology for dynamic viewpoint selection for maturity classification of red and yellow sweet peppers. The method makes an online decision to capture an additional next-best viewpoint based on an economic analysis that considers potential misclassification and robot operational costs. The next-best viewpoint is selected based on color variations on the pepper. Peppers were classified into mature and immature using a random forest classifier based on principle components of various color features derived from an RGB-D camera. The method first attempts to classify maturity based on a single viewpoint. An additional viewpoint is acquired and added to the point cloud only when it is deemed profitable. The methodology was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation on datasets of 69 red and 70 yellow sweet peppers from three different maturity stages. Classification accuracy was increased by 6% and 5% using dynamic viewpoint selection along with 52% and 12% decrease in economic costs for red and yellow peppers, respectively, compared to using a single viewpoint. Sensitivity analyses were performed for misclassification and robot operational costs. ? 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",

      "year": "2022",
      "abstract": "Multi-machine harvesting has been the popular form to improve the operation efficiency of the combine harvester, particularly with agricultural intensification, scale, and industrialization. The demand can also be required for the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless communication of the combine harvester group. However, the current communication technologies of the IoT cannot fully meet the unstructured and large-scale agricultural scenarios, due mainly to the industrial design with the relatively short communication distance, low reliability, and high cost. Fortunately, the LoRa technology has unique advantages in the transmission distance, transmission rate, node capacity, and deployment mode. Moreover, the lower cost is suitable for the large-scale deployment of agricultural vehicles. At the same time, the parameters of LoRa technology can fully meet the needs of wireless communication in the operation scenario of combine harvester group. In addition, the 2.4 GHz band can further improve the performance of LoRa technology and regional universality. Therefore, wireless communication can be expected to apply to the scenario of combine harvester group. In this study, a communication network structure was proposed for the working mode of combine harvester group using the 2.4 GHz LoRa technology. Firstly, the LoRa network structure was constructed for the joint harvester cluster in the form of host and slave. The working mode of each node was then set using the cooperative operation scenario of the harvesters group. A radio frequency chip model (SX1280) was selected to simulate the transceiver mode, according to the application scenario. The optimal path attenuation model was chosen for the maximum communication distance between the master and slave. Secondly, a simulation model was established to optimize the application parameters of LoRa using NS-3 network platform, including the bandwidth, coding rate, spreading factor, transmission power, and frequency. The static and moving state of network nodes were used for the simulation scenarios of combine harvester communication network. Once the network nodes were fixed, a circular area with a radius of 3 km was selected as the deployment range of all network nodes. All network nodes were deployed in the circular range, according to the law of uniform distribution. The allocation scheme of spread spectrum factor was selected to accommodate the number of nodes and the minimum transmission interval in the simulated communication scenario of combine harvester cluster. Finally, the hardware and software were designed for the hardware terminal in the communication protocol of the combine harvester group. Both simulation and field experiments were conducted to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the new LoRa for the combine harvesters group. The simulation results show that the spread spectrum factor with the specific proportion improved the network communication performance in the application scenario. When more than 90% of the reception success rate was guaranteed, the 1 625 kHz bandwidth supported by the 25 nodes to communicate at a 1 s transmission interval in a static scenario. In the dynamic scenario, the communication delay was less than 10 ms under 1 625 kHz bandwidth. The field test results show that the overall success rates of communication were 99.3%, and 92.5% under the ¡°Report¡± and ¡°Request¡± modes, respectively. The average response time was 123.07 ms. Consequently, the LoRa technology was applied for wireless communication between the combine harvesters, which can fully meet the requirements of joint harvester cluster communication for the number of accommodated devices and transmission interval. The number of nodes in the cluster can also be adjusted appropriately, according to the requirements for the communication interval. The Report mode supported the higher communication frequencies suitable for the reporting data from the combined harvesters, while the Request mode was suitable for the lower frequency, and responsive communications. The finding can provide a feasible solution to the mutual communication of the combine harvester clusters during cooperative operation. ? 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "title": "Method for locating picking points of grape clusters using multi-object recognition; [»ùÓÚ¶àÄ¿±êÊ¶±ðµÄÆÏÌÑ¹û´®²ÉÕªµã¶¨Î»·½·¨]",
      "year": "2023",
      "abstract": "Grape-picking robots can be an effective solution to deal with the contradiction between manual labor efficiency and the limited harvesting period, with the rapid development of machine vision and artificial intelligence. The varying sizes and shapes of grape key structures have limited the working space of the robot at the grape harvesting stage. Improper positioning of picking points can also lead to collisions between the robot's end and the grapes, even the damage and dropping. In addition, it is necessary to consider such collisions between the robot's end and the fruit branches. The reason is that these collisions can result in failed picking, damage to the branches, and the risk of fungal infection in the fruit trees. In this study, the localization algorithm was proposed for the picking points of grape key structures using deep learning and multi-object recognition. Picking point localization was enhanced to reduce the grape damage and the failure rate during harvesting. Firstly, the G-YOLACT++ model incorporated the SimAM attention module and Mish activation function to optimize the YOLACT++ model. Then the key grape structures were detected, such as grape-bearing branches, grape peduncles, and grape clusters. As such, these grape structures in the multi-adjacent clusters were segmented into multiple masks within the field of view. The membership of grape key structures was determined within the same cluster using their intersection and relative positions. The same string of grapes was then merged to select the Region of Interest (ROI) area with the low collision for grape pedicles. The range of re-selection was also designed to locate the picking point. The experimental results demonstrated that the incorporation of the SimAM attention mechanism into the YOLACT++ model resulted in an improved mean average precision (mAP) for the mask. The Mish activation function was selected to replace the ReLU in the backbone network. After that, the mAP values of the mask and bounding box increased by 0.3 and 2.23 percentage points, respectively. Both modifications were greatly contributed to the enhancement of the performance. The average mAP values of the bounding box and mask in G-YOLACT++ were improved by 0.83 and 0.88 percentage points, respectively, compared with the YOLACT++. By contrast, the mAP values of the improved model for the bounding box and mask increased by 2.36 and 2.13 percentage points, respectively, compared with the original. Furthermore, the sizes of all the improved models remained unchanged, while there was a relatively slight improvement in the inference speed. Therefore, there was a positive effect of improvement on the performance of the models. The correctness rates of the single and multiple fruit samples were 88% and 90%, respectively, for the key structure-dependent judgment and fusion. The correctness rate was 92.3% for the removal of grape clusters with the incomplete recognition of key structures. Compared to the two positioning methods that use the center of the bounding rectangle enclosing the grape peduncles in ROI and the centroid of the grape peduncles identified by the model as the picking points, the success rates of the picking point localization method in this study were improved by 10.95 and 81.75 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrated the research could be a viable support to the optimization of grape picking robots and lays the foundation for low-damage harvesting of clustered fruits in unstructured environments. ? 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

      "year": "2022",
      "abstract": "Planting pattern of cotton can be optimized for the higher yield, quality and efficiency production in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. However, it is still unclear about the effects of machine-harvested cotton planting pattern on the agricultural machinery and techniques in the spray application of chemical harvest-aid. In this study, a field experiment was carried out to clarify the effects, with two planting patterns of machine-harvested cotton, including the ¡°aimizao¡± planting pattern (six lines per film with the wide-narrow row spacing, 66 + 10 cm, R6), and the ¡°kuanzaoyou¡± planting pattern (three lines per film with equal row spacing, 76 cm, R3), as well as with two chemical defoliant spraying machines, including an agricultural drone sprayer (UAV), and a ground-based boom sprayer (MTZ). A representative canopy of four individual plants was selected in each pattern-sprayer combination. Some parameters were also measured for each leaf, including the volume diameter, coverage rate, and deposition amount of defoliant spray droplets. A systematic analysis was made on the effects of planting mode on the deposition and dissipation characteristics of defoliant droplets. An optimal defoliation efficiency of the cotton before the plants were determined ready for the mechanical harvesting. The results showed that there were significant differences between the UAV and MTZ in the volume diameter distribution, droplet coverage rate, deposition amount, and loss magnitude of the defoliant spray droplets (P<0.01). There was the more uniform distribution in the volume diameter of the droplet, when the defoliant was sprayed using UAV. 2.60% proportion was found in the most effective droplet with the size between 100-300 ¦Ìm for the MTZ, which was improved by 58.40 percentage points to 61.00% for the UAV. The droplet coverage rates of UAV and MTZ were 3.22% and 42.05%, respectively. The coverage rate of MTZ was about 13 times higher than that of UAV. But, the droplet deposition amount of UAV and MTZ was 0.49 and 0.69 ¦Ìg/cm2, respectively. Among them, the deposition amount of MTZ was only 71.00% of UAV, indicating the low capacity but high concentration of the UAV. Furthermore, the coverage rate and deposition amount in the lower part of the cotton canopy decreased by 17.99%, and 17.63%, respectively, using MTZ, but decreased by 35.45% and 53.71%, respectively, using UAV, compared with the upper part of the cotton canopy. Therefore, the penetration of spray droplets in the UAV was insufficient to reach the lower canopy. The droplet deposition loss between the cotton canopy rows of the MTZ was 1.91 times as large as that of the UAV. Different planting patterns of machine-harvested cotton also showed a significant effect on the deposition of spray droplet. More importantly, the coverage rate and deposition amount in the lower canopy increased by 18.59 percentage points and 0.33 ¦Ìg/cm2 (117.60%, and 125.60% for the relative differences), respectively, in the ¡°kuanzaoyou¡± planting pattern, compared with the ¡°aimizao¡±. By contrast, there was the decrease in the coefficient of variation by 43.73, and 31.63 percentage points (43.83%, and 36.00% for the relative differences), respectively. It infers that the ¡°kuanzaoyou¡± planting mode was improved the penetration and uniformity of droplets in the canopy, especially for the middle-lower canopy layers. There was a great benefit in the penetration of UAV. All of the final defoliation rates reached a range of 90%-94% after spraying once by the BGM or twice by the UAV, fully meeting the harsh requirement of cotton mechanical harvesting operation. In conclusion, the UAV chemical defoliant spraying at the planting mode of ¡°kuanzaoyou¡± can be expected to reduce the potential impact on the cotton growth and soil environment, due to the non-contact operation and reasonable distribution of droplet size. The finding can provide a strong reference for the mechanical harvesting of cotton to the chemical defoliation. ? 2022 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.",

      "year": "2023",
      "abstract": "Autonomous navigation is an important guarantee for intelligent agricultural machinery to complete harvesting operations. Navigation line recognition is an important step in achieving autonomous navigation of intelligent agricultural machinery. Real-time and accurate detection of harvesting navigation lines can effectively accelerate the progress of operations and reduce crop loss rates. Visual sensors have the advantages of low cost and rich information acquisition, making them widely used in route detection. Frequent changes in lighting under cloudy weather make it difficult for a single feature to cope with wheat field environments. In this study, a wheat harvesting boundary detection method based on multi texture feature fusion was proposed. In the harvested area, the characteristics of low stubble and no top wheat ears result in differences in uniformity, density, and other aspects when harvesting under both light and backlight compared to the non-harvested area. At the same time, due to the exposed wheat stubble in the harvested area, it appears more regular on the image, and its gradient direction is more consistent than that in the non-harvested area. Therefore, a two-dimensional feature vector composed of image entropy and directional gradient was constructed to classify the harvested and unharvested areas of the wheat field, and then the harvesting boundary was extracted. Due to the susceptibility of image entropy features to perspective phenomena, this paper compared the entropy features of different regions in the image when fixing the camera installation angle and height, and ultimately selected the middle region of the image as the region of interest. After analyzing the characteristics of image entropy feature extraction, a histogram statistical method based on sliding windows was proposed to accelerate the speed of image entropy feature extraction. By further dividing the window to be calculated into several sub windows, sliding and combining these sub windows significantly reduced the computation. The entropy feature extraction in this paper took 0.53 seconds, which is 49.52% faster than the traditional method of directly extracting entropy from the entire window. After extracting two-dimensional features, based on the distribution characteristics of the feature histogram and combined with the maximum entropy threshold segmentation algorithm, the wheat field image was preliminarily classified. For entropy features, low noise points affected the threshold segmentation effect. By comparing the impact of discarding different proportions of low entropy points on the segmentation threshold, this paper discarded 10% of low entropy points, enhancing the threshold segmentation effect. The method of removing small connected regions was used to eliminate the misclassified regions in the initial classification binary image. Then, the Canny operator was used to extract edge contour points distributed near the harvesting boundary. Due to the consistent direction between the harvesting boundary and the agricultural machinery's forward direction, the Ransac algorithm was used to restrict the fitting line in the region, obtaining the accurate harvesting boundary. In order to verify the feasibility of the method proposed in this article, wheat field images under different lighting conditions were collected, including 2 200 weak light images, 758 local strong light images, and 1 134 strong light images. After selecting the region of interest, the size of the image to be processed was 240 pixels¡Á1 280 pixels. The algorithm in this paper took an average of 0.88 s to process each image on laptops. The detection rates under weak light, local strong light, and strong light were 90.41%, 88.26%, and 89.68%, respectively, with an average of 89.45%. Compared with the traditional method of using Adaboost algorithm for machine learning, the detection speed of this algorithm was improved by 73.89%, and the detection rate was increased by 46.19 percentage points, 46.00 percentage points, and 49.64 percentage points under weak light, local strong light, and strong light, respectively. Compared with traditional algorithms, the method proposed in this paper significantly improved real-time performance and detection rate, which can provide reference for the detection of field agricultural machinery navigation lines. ? 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Therefore, automatic robots of citrus picking have become a hot topic in recent research. A citrus image recognition algorithm was designed for the core machine vision part of the citrus picking robot.

By comprehensively comparing the Hough transform under the three edge operators Canny, Sobel and LOG, we finally determined the optimal solution for citrus image recognition. The experimental results show that the Hough transform based on the Sobel edge detection operator is the best, with a success rate of 97% for a single citrus without branch and leaf shading, 90% for a single citrus with branch and leaf shading, and 80.6% for multiple overlapping citrus.This algorithm can effectively guarantee the probability of successful identification of citrus to a certain extent. ?
