- **Action required**: Create comprehensive reference mapping

## Recommendations for Table 7

1. **Use N=50 Studies** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Maintain 2x2 classification matrix** for consistency with Table 4
3. **Focus on agricultural robotics applications** rather than generic motion planning
4. **Include performance metrics** based on real experimental data from papers
5. **Ensure all references** are verified in ref.bib

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed performance data extraction for each paper
2. Map all 50 papers to their ref.bib entries
3. Generate the final Table 7 with real performance metrics
4. Validate all references for authenticity
