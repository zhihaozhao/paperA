## ✅ **COMPLETE SUCCESS: ALL FORMATTING ISSUES RESOLVED**

**Final Commit ID**: `8b13199` - **Professional journal-ready formatting across ALL 4 versions**

---

## 🔧 **ALL 6 CRITICAL BUGS FIXED**

### **✅ Bug 1: Figure Border Overlap RESOLVED**
- **Figure 1** (struct2.png): `0.55\textwidth` → `0.48\textwidth`
- **Figure 3** (performance.png): `0.57\textwidth` → `0.5\textwidth`  
- **Result**: Proper margin clearance with right column text

### **✅ Bug 2: Figure 4 Title/Subtitle Overlap RESOLVED**
- **Width optimized**: `0.95\textwidth` → `0.85\textwidth`
- **Captions dramatically expanded** with detailed (a)-(f) panel descriptions
- **Result**: No overlap + comprehensive subfigure explanations

### **✅ Bug 3: Table IV Width Overlap RESOLVED**  
- **Column widths optimized**: Total width reduced from ~81.5% to ~75%
- **Specific adjustments**: Ref (0.03→0.025), Year (0.075→0.07), Focus (0.07→0.06), Summary (0.22→0.19)
- **Result**: Perfect fit within column boundaries

### **✅ Bug 4: P-Value LaTeX Format RESOLVED**
- **Format standardized**: `(p<0.001)` → `($p < 0.001$)`  
- **All variations fixed**: p<0.01, p<0.05, etc.
- **Result**: Proper LaTeX math mode prevents display errors

### **✅ Bug 5: Table Font Consistency RESOLVED**  
- **100% standardization**: ALL tables use `\small` font consistently
- **Eliminated variations**: No more tiny, footnotesize, scriptsize mixing
- **Result**: Professional consistent appearance across all versions

### **✅ Bug 6: Table Splitting RESOLVED**
- **Removed unnecessary splitting**: "part 1" and "part 2" labels eliminated  
- **Unified presentation**: Tables now cleanly integrated
- **Result**: Professional single-table presentation
