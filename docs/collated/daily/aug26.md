## Daily Summary â€” Aug 26

- Thesis tweaks: fixed title-page line break; added appendices/results_tables.tex; installed LaTeX toolchain; temp-disabled corrupted experiments include to compile; set CJK font/headheight (kept minimal impact).
- Mirrored datasets: copied `results/` and `results_gpu/` from `results/main` into `feat/enhanced-model-and-sweep`; pushed.
- D5/D6 experiments: summarized metrics; added Python plotting under `paper/figures/plot_d5_d6.py` (implementation in `scripts/plot_d5_d6.py`).
- Figures/Tables: inserted D5/D6 subsection in `paper/main.tex`; switched to minimal monochrome slopegraph (`figures/d5_d6_results_slope.pdf`); inlined the D5/D6 table (no external input file).
- Git housekeeping: handled rebase, push, and clarified ignoring build/log artifacts.

Next:
- Collate docs into categorized subfolders; generate a manifest of all Markdown docs.
