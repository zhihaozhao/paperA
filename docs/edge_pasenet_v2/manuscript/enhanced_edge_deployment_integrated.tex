\subsection{Mobile and Edge Deployment Performance Analysis}

To validate the practical feasibility of PASE-Net for real-world IoT deployments, we conduct comprehensive performance evaluation on the NVIDIA Xavier AGX 32G edge computing platform, representing a typical high-performance embedded system used in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart infrastructure applications. This analysis addresses critical deployment considerations including inference latency, throughput scalability, power efficiency, and memory footprint—factors essential for mobile and edge computing scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

\subsubsection{Edge Computing Platform Evaluation}

The Xavier AGX 32G platform features an ARM-based processor with integrated GPU acceleration capabilities, providing 32GB unified memory and CUDA compute capability 7.2. This configuration represents a realistic edge deployment scenario where models must balance performance with power constraints. We evaluate both CPU and GPU execution modes to understand the performance-power trade-offs crucial for different deployment contexts.

Table~\ref{tab:edge_performance} presents comprehensive performance measurements across three D1 parameter-aligned models under identical hardware conditions. The results reveal dramatic performance differences between CPU and GPU execution modes, with GPU acceleration providing 8-64× speedup across all model architectures. Most significantly, PASE-Net transforms from a non-real-time CPU implementation (338.91ms) to a highly responsive GPU implementation (5.29ms), crossing the critical 10ms threshold required for real-time HAR applications.

\subsubsection{Batch Processing and Throughput Analysis}

Edge computing scenarios often involve processing multiple sensor streams simultaneously or handling burst traffic from multiple IoT devices. To address these requirements, we evaluate batch processing capabilities across different batch sizes (1, 4, 8 samples), measuring both total processing time and per-sample efficiency. Figure~\ref{fig:batch_throughput} illustrates the throughput scaling characteristics, revealing that batch processing provides substantial efficiency improvements for all models.

The PASE-Net model demonstrates excellent batch processing efficiency, with per-sample inference time reducing from 5.29ms (batch=1) to 1.65ms (batch=8), representing a 3.2× efficiency improvement. This characteristic is particularly valuable for gateway devices that aggregate sensor data from multiple sources or mobile applications that can buffer short sequences for batch processing.

CNN achieves the highest absolute throughput with 7,076 samples/second at batch=8, making it ideal for high-frequency monitoring scenarios such as continuous gesture recognition or fine-grained activity tracking. The BiLSTM model, while slower in absolute terms, still achieves practical real-time performance with 851 samples/second throughput, suitable for temporal sequence analysis applications.

\subsubsection{Power and Resource Efficiency Considerations}

Mobile and IoT deployments require careful consideration of power consumption and computational efficiency. The Xavier AGX 32G platform provides configurable power modes that trade performance for energy efficiency. Our analysis reveals that CPU-only operation consumes approximately 10W during inference, suitable for battery-powered applications where PASE-Net's 339ms latency may be acceptable for periodic monitoring.

GPU-accelerated operation increases power consumption to 15-30W but delivers transformative performance improvements that enable continuous real-time monitoring. This creates opportunities for hybrid deployment strategies: using CPU mode for low-power background monitoring with GPU burst processing triggered by detected events or during periods of external power availability.

The consistent <2.5MB memory footprint across all models ensures compatibility with resource-constrained edge devices. Unlike transformer-based architectures that require substantial memory for attention mechanisms, PASE-Net's efficient SE and temporal attention design maintains compact memory usage while delivering superior performance.

\subsubsection{Deployment Strategy Recommendations}

Based on our comprehensive edge performance analysis, we propose deployment strategies tailored to different IoT scenarios:

\textbf{Smart Home Hubs:} Deploy PASE-Net on GPU mode (1.65ms latency) for comprehensive activity recognition with attention-based interpretability. The 607 samples/second throughput supports multiple concurrent sensor streams.

\textbf{Wearable Devices:} Utilize CNN model in CPU mode (7.13ms) to balance performance with battery life. The lightweight architecture and real-time performance satisfy continuous monitoring requirements while preserving energy.

\textbf{Industrial IoT Gateways:} Implement dynamic model selection based on power availability and workload characteristics. Use batch processing (batch=8) to maximize throughput efficiency during peak usage periods.

\textbf{Mobile Applications:} Leverage batch processing capabilities for user experience optimization. Buffer 4-8 samples for 2-4× efficiency improvement while maintaining responsive user interaction.

\subsubsection{Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art}

Our edge deployment results demonstrate significant advantages over existing WiFi HAR approaches. Table~\ref{tab:literature_performance_comparison} presents a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art WiFi HAR systems from recent literature. The comparison reveals that our Xavier AGX 32G implementations achieve superior performance across multiple metrics: parameter efficiency (640K vs. 750K-1200K in literature), memory footprint (2.23-2.46MB vs. 2.9-4.6MB), and most critically, inference latency and throughput.

While recent work reports deployment on resource-constrained devices, few provide comprehensive latency and throughput analysis across different batch sizes and hardware configurations. Literature benchmarks show inference times ranging from 45ms to 120ms on various edge devices, with throughput typically limited to 8-22 samples per second. In contrast, our GPU-accelerated implementations achieve sub-10ms latency with throughput exceeding 100 samples per second for all models, representing 5-15× improvement in processing speed.

The 64× GPU speedup for PASE-Net represents a substantial improvement in deployment feasibility, transforming attention-based models from research prototypes to production-ready systems. Most significantly, our approach demonstrates that sophisticated attention mechanisms, previously considered computationally prohibitive for edge deployment, can achieve real-time performance through appropriate hardware acceleration.

The consistent sub-10ms GPU performance across all evaluated models establishes a new baseline for real-time WiFi HAR deployment, enabling applications previously limited by computational constraints. This performance level supports emerging requirements such as multi-user concurrent monitoring, high-frequency gesture recognition, and safety-critical applications where rapid response is essential.

\subsubsection{Deployment Strategy Analysis}

The diverse requirements of IoT deployment scenarios necessitate systematic analysis of model-hardware combinations to optimize performance, power consumption, and deployment complexity. Figure~\ref{fig:deployment_strategy} presents a comprehensive deployment strategy analysis, examining suitability scores across seven representative IoT scenarios and analyzing the fundamental trade-offs between performance and energy efficiency.

Our analysis reveals distinct optimization patterns for different deployment contexts. Smart home hubs and IoT gateways benefit from GPU-accelerated PASE-Net configurations, leveraging available wall power to achieve maximum throughput for multi-user scenarios. Conversely, wearable devices and healthcare monitors prioritize energy efficiency, making CPU-based CNN implementations optimal despite reduced absolute performance. Industrial monitoring and autonomous vehicle applications require ultra-low latency, where GPU acceleration becomes essential regardless of power consumption.

Table~\ref{tab:deployment_scenarios} provides detailed requirements analysis for each deployment scenario, including specific hardware recommendations and design rationales. This systematic approach enables practitioners to select optimal configurations based on deployment constraints rather than relying on generic benchmarks.
