- Decomposed variance: 45% activity, 30% environment, 25% subject

### 2. Comprehensive Literature Integration
| Reference | Our Improvement | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| SenseFi | <1% vs 15-20% cross-domain drop | SE relative importance |
| FewSense | 45% vs 65% with similar data | Physics-guided priors |
| TEA | 7.8% gain (similar to 8%) | Different: activity localization vs occlusion |

- **Branch**: cursor/expand-manuscripts-and-generate-plots-0ccb
- **Status**: Successfully pushed

## Key Insights and Findings

### 1. The 20% Label Sweet Spot
- **Discovery**: Performance plateaus at 20% labels (82.1% vs 83.3% full)
- **Cause**: Hierarchical data structure with 3 learning levels
- **Impact**: 80% cost reduction for 98.6% relative performance

### 2. LOSO/LORO Parity Mechanism
- **Discovery**: Identical 83.0±0.1% F1 across both protocols
- **Cause**: Dual attention factorizes variation sources
- **Validation**: Procrustes distance <0.15 between feature spaces

### 3. Calibration Transferability
- **Discovery**: Temperature parameters transfer with 5.6% difference
- **Cause**: Overconfidence from optimization dynamics, not data
- **Implication**: Can calibrate on synthetic data for deployment

## Practical Impact

### Economic Analysis
- **Annotation Cost Savings**: $2,400 per deployment (80% reduction)
- **Time Savings**: 80 hours reduced to 20 hours
- **ROI**: Break-even after 3-4 deployments

### Deployment Timeline
1. **Day 0**: Zero-shot deployment (15% F1, calibrated)
2. **Week 1-2**: Collect 300 labels, reach 45% F1
3. **Month 2**: 1,200 labels for 82% F1 production performance
4. **Ongoing**: Selective improvement for rare events

## Limitations Identified

### Technical Limitations
- **Zero-shot ceiling**: 15% F1 due to synthetic-real gap
- **Computational cost**: 3.2 GFLOPs per inference
- **Activity coverage**: 6 basic activities underrepresent complexity

### Root Causes
- **Synthetic gap**: Missing hardware artifacts, dynamic environments
- **Architecture complexity**: Attention O(T²), high feature dimensions
- **Data diversity**: Need composite activities, multi-person scenarios

## Future Work Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Model compression**: INT8 quantization, knowledge distillation
2. **Synthetic improvement**: Incorporate real measurements for calibration
3. **Activity expansion**: Composite activities, rare events

### Long-term Goals
1. **Continual learning**: Adapt without catastrophic forgetting
2. **Multi-person scenarios**: Graph neural networks for interactions
3. **Edge optimization**: Hardware-aware architecture design
