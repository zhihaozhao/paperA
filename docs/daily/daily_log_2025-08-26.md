# Daily Log – 2025-08-26

Scope: Figures 2–6 layout fixes; fonts unification; LaTeX edits; table policy updates; docs added.

## Major changes
- Figure 2 (scr2_physics_guided_framework.py)
  - Converted to clean 2D flow; reversed left column (bottom→top); increased inter-module spacing
  - Extended right dashed container; enlarged internal blocks to prevent text overflow; ensured arrow from Enhanced→right
  - Adjusted title padding to avoid overlap
- Figure 3 (scr3_enhanced_model_dataflow.py)
  - Rebuilt as 2D detailed model, 2×4 layout; widened boxes; explicit wrapping; robust elbow arrows
  - Bottom row flows right→left; vertical transition at rightmost column
- Figure 4 (scr4_experimental_protocols.py)
  - Unified fonts (text 12 / title 14); widened/tallened boxes, wrapped labels; expanded canvas bounds
  - Regenerated three outputs (protocols, flowchart, overview)
- Figure 5 (scr5_cross_domain.py)
  - Re-laid to spec; fixed blank (d), swapped (b)/(c), lowered (b); rotated x labels; nudged (d)/(e) to avoid overlaps
  - Targeted enlargement of (b),(c); unified fonts; regenerated PDF and committed artifacts
- Figure 6 (scr6_pca_analysis.py)
  - Restored overall subplot heights; widened (d) by moving colorbar to side axes; (e) legend moved left-outside
  - Unified fonts; adjusted GridSpec and margins; regenerated
- LaTeX (paper/main.tex)
  - Dropped literature parameter table (insufficient reported params per WiFi-CSI papers)
  - Updated Figure 2 references and caption from 3D→2D wording; preserved Key Contributions list

## Notable commits (chronological, subset)
- fig2/fig3 2D redesigns and spacing: 07915a6, 6a8caed, 6356c26, 10aea7a, 7c58d91
- fig5 fixes: a582749, 497263f, f0b0a1d, 3173c1d
- fig6 row3 enlargement + fonts + legend positioning: 7bfb3dc, 628a096, 3ee9c47, 53e5640, a74cb7c
- fig4 fonts and overflow: 6b52a91
- PDFs added (fig5, fig6): 447546c
- Drop literature table: 23f8a89

## Outstanding items / next steps
- Apply prose/style rewrites across main.tex (retain Key Contributions list), per 5-point guideline; keep numbers/claims intact
- Final pass on figure label consistency and spacing after full PDF compile
