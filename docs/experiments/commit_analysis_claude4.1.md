  - Value: Critical experiment specifications
  
- **966fe21**: `docs(exp2): scaffold Mamba replacement experiment with docs and stub code`
  - Value: Novel Mamba SSM implementation scaffold
  
- **3446679**: `docs(exp1): scaffold multi-scale LSTM + lite attention + PINN experiment`
  - Value: Physics-informed neural network experiment setup
  
- **0625e11**: `docs(experiments): fill proposals/analysis_and_feasibility.md`
  - Value: Feasibility analysis for research directions
  
- **c6fb62d**: `docs(experiments): add REPRO_PLAN, PARAMS_METRICS, and metrics collector`
  - Value: Reproducibility infrastructure
  
- **ae33d7d**: `docs(experiments): scaffold experiments workspace, baseline folders`
  - Value: Initial experimental structure

### 2. Figure Generation (Medium-High Value)
Important visualizations for the paper:

- **f416f27**: `feat(fig2,fig3-3d): add 3D brick-layout figures with fonts`
  - Value: Key architecture visualizations
  
- **447546c**: `chore(figures): add generated PDFs fig5_cross_domain.pdf and fig6_pca_analysis.pdf`
  - Value: Result visualizations

### 3. Paper Content (High Value)
Substantive paper improvements:

- **142d60a**: `docs(main): remove lone subsubsections; merge short enumerations; fix wording`
  - Value: Paper structure improvements
  
- **23f8a89**: `docs(tables): drop literature comparison table due to lack of reported parameters`
  - Value: Important editorial decision

### 4. Documentation (High Value)
Research documentation and planning:

- **9433500**: `docs(daily): add figure script size/position notes and daily log`
  - Value: Research process documentation

## Duplicate/Low-Value Commits (Can Be Squashed)

### Figure Styling Iterations
These commits represent iterative styling adjustments that could be squashed:

- Multiple commits adjusting font sizes (12pt, 14pt)
- Multiple commits adjusting figure layouts and spacing
- Multiple commits for label positioning
- Commits: 6b52a91, a74cb7c, 53e5640, 3173c1d, 3ee9c47, f0b0a1d, 7c58d91, 628a096, 497263f, etc.

**Recommendation**: Squash all figure styling commits into one: "style(figures): unified font sizes, layouts, and positioning"

### Minor Fixes
Small fixes that could be combined:

- **46888c7**: `missed \% added on Aug26`
- **f8a67d0**: `csv path verify on Aug26`
- **50dea9a**: `fix(refs): sanitize author field`

**Recommendation**: Combine into "fix(minor): LaTeX escaping and path corrections"

### Checkpoint Commits
Non-descriptive checkpoint commits should be removed:

- **8a351b7**: `Checkpoint before follow-up message`
- **4d8e8d3**: `Checkpoint before follow-up message`
- **7960bcc**: `Checkpoint before follow-up message`

**Recommendation**: Remove or squash with next meaningful commit

## Commit Quality Analysis

### Good Practices Observed
1. **Semantic commit messages**: Using conventional commit format (feat, fix, docs, style, chore)
2. **Descriptive messages**: Most commits clearly describe changes
3. **Atomic commits**: Many commits focus on single concerns

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Too many styling iterations**: Could use feature branches for figure work
2. **Checkpoint commits**: Should use more descriptive messages
3. **Some commits too granular**: Minor fixes could be batched

## Recommended Git History Cleanup

### Interactive Rebase Strategy
```bash
# Start interactive rebase for last 50 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~50

# Suggested actions:
# 1. Squash all figure styling commits (20+ commits â†’ 3-4 commits)
# 2. Remove checkpoint commits
# 3. Combine minor fixes
# 4. Keep all experiment scaffolding commits
# 5. Keep paper content changes
```

### Proposed Cleaned History Structure
1. Initial experiment infrastructure (ae33d7d, c6fb62d)
2. Baseline reproductions and metrics (0625e11)
3. Exp1: Physics-informed LSTM scaffold (3446679)
4. Exp2: Mamba SSM scaffold (966fe21)
5. Baseline references and specifications (eb7ee67)
6. Figure generation suite (combined)
7. Figure styling and layout (combined)
8. Paper content refinements (142d60a, 23f8a89)
9. Documentation and daily logs (9433500)

## Value Assessment by Category

### High Value (Must Keep)
- Experiment scaffolding: 6 commits
- Paper content: 2 commits
- Documentation: 1 commit
- **Total**: 9 commits

### Medium Value (Keep but Could Combine)
- Figure generation: 2 commits
- Bibliography fixes: 1 commit
- **Total**: 3 commits

### Low Value (Squash or Remove)
- Figure styling iterations: ~25 commits
- Checkpoint commits: 3 commits
- Minor fixes: 3 commits
- **Total**: ~31 commits

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Do NOT rebase** if commits are already pushed to shared branch
2. For future work, use feature branches for iterative styling
3. Write more descriptive commit messages instead of "Checkpoint"

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Batch related changes**: Collect figure adjustments before committing
2. **Use conventional commits**: Continue feat/fix/docs/style prefixes
3. **Atomic but not too granular**: Balance between atomic and meaningful
4. **Document rationale**: Include "why" in commit messages, not just "what"

### Git Workflow Improvements
```bash
# Before committing figure changes
git add paper/PlotPy/scr*.py
git commit -m "style(figures): adjust all figures to consistent 12pt text, 14pt titles"

# Instead of multiple commits for each figure
# NOT: "fix fig2 font", "fix fig3 font", "fix fig4 font"
```

## Conclusion

The commit history shows active development with good experimental scaffolding and documentation. The main issue is excessive granularity in figure styling commits, which creates noise in the history. The experimental infrastructure commits are high-value and well-structured. Going forward, batching related changes and using feature branches for iterative work would improve history clarity.

**Net Result**: From 50 commits, approximately 12-15 commits contain unique, valuable changes. The rest are iterations that could be combined without loss of information.
