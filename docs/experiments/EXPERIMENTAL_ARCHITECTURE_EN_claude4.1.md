## Chapter 1: Introduction and Motivation

### 1.1 Research Background

The proliferation of WiFi infrastructure has created unprecedented opportunities for device-free sensing applications. Channel State Information (CSI), which captures the propagation characteristics of wireless signals, has emerged as a powerful sensing modality for human activity recognition. However, existing approaches face significant challenges in cross-domain generalization, physical interpretability, and computational efficiency.

This experimental architecture addresses these challenges through a systematic progression of model innovations, from data-driven enhanced models to physics-informed approaches and state-space modeling paradigms. The architecture is designed to facilitate reproducible research while advancing both theoretical understanding and practical deployment capabilities.

### 1.2 Architectural Overview

Our experimental framework consists of three hierarchical layers:

1. **Foundation Layer**: The Enhanced Model serves as our performance baseline, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy through advanced attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature extraction.

2. **Innovation Layer**: Two complementary experimental models (Exp1 and Exp2) explore orthogonal research directions:
   - Exp1: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) incorporating Fresnel zone theory, multipath propagation, and Doppler effects
   - Exp2: Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) for efficient long-range temporal modeling

3. **Extension Layer**: Five cutting-edge research directions extend the core capabilities:
   - Multimodal Fusion: Integration with visual and acoustic modalities
   - Federated Learning: Privacy-preserving distributed training
   - Neural Architecture Search: Automated model optimization
   - Causal Inference: Understanding sensing mechanisms
   - Continual Learning: Adaptation to evolving environments

### 1.3 Key Contributions

This experimental architecture makes the following contributions:

1. **Systematic Evaluation Framework**: We establish comprehensive evaluation protocols including Cross-Domain Activity Evaluation (CDAE) and Small-Target Environment Adaptation (STEA), providing standardized benchmarks for fair comparison.

2. **Physics-Informed Design Principles**: We integrate domain knowledge from wireless communication theory into neural network architectures, improving interpretability and generalization.

3. **Computational Efficiency Optimization**: Through state-space modeling and lightweight attention mechanisms, we achieve real-time inference capabilities suitable for edge deployment.

4. **Reproducible Research Infrastructure**: We provide complete implementation code, pre-trained models, and detailed documentation to facilitate community adoption and extension.

## Chapter 2: Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 WiFi CSI Fundamentals

Channel State Information represents the channel properties of a communication link, describing how a signal propagates from transmitter to receiver. In the frequency domain, CSI can be expressed as:

```
H(f,t) = |H(f,t)| × exp(j∠H(f,t))
```

where |H(f,t)| represents amplitude and ∠H(f,t) represents phase information across frequency f and time t.

The CSI captures various physical phenomena:

1. **Path Loss**: Signal attenuation due to distance
2. **Multipath Fading**: Constructive and destructive interference from reflected signals
3. **Doppler Shift**: Frequency changes due to motion
4. **Shadowing**: Signal blockage by human bodies

### 2.2 Physics-Informed Neural Network Principles

Our Exp1 model incorporates physical constraints through specialized loss functions:

```
L_total = L_task + λ₁L_fresnel + λ₂L_multipath + λ₃L_doppler
```

where:
- L_task: Standard classification/regression loss
- L_fresnel: Fresnel zone consistency constraint
- L_multipath: Multipath propagation model adherence
- L_doppler: Doppler shift physical constraints

### 2.3 State-Space Model Theory

The Exp2 model leverages structured state-space models (SSMs) for sequence modeling:

```
dx/dt = Ax + Bu
y = Cx + Du
```

This formulation enables linear-time complexity for long sequences while maintaining strong modeling capacity through learned dynamics matrices.
