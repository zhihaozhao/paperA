\begin{abstract}
The scarcity of labeled WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) data poses a fundamental challenge for training robust human activity recognition (HAR) systems, particularly when deploying across diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics. This paper introduces DiffusionCSI, a novel framework that leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate realistic synthetic CSI measurements for data augmentation. Unlike traditional augmentation techniques that apply simple transformations, DiffusionCSI learns the underlying data distribution through a reverse diffusion process, enabling generation of physically plausible CSI patterns that capture complex multipath propagation, frequency-selective fading, and human motion dynamics. We formulate CSI generation as a conditional diffusion process, where the model learns to denoise progressively from Gaussian noise to realistic CSI conditioned on activity labels and optional environmental parameters. The architecture incorporates U-Net backbone with specialized CSI-aware modifications: frequency-aligned convolutions that respect subcarrier structure, temporal consistency constraints that maintain motion continuity, and physics-informed guidance that ensures generated samples obey wireless propagation principles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that augmenting real data with DiffusionCSI-generated samples improves classification accuracy by [PLACEHOLDER: XX.X±X.X]\% on the SenseFi benchmark, with particularly significant gains in few-shot scenarios where only [PLACEHOLDER: XX]\% of real data is available. Quality assessment through Fréchet CSI Distance (FCD) shows generated samples achieve [PLACEHOLDER: X.XX] score, indicating high fidelity to real CSI distributions. Ablation studies reveal that physics-informed guidance reduces generation of out-of-distribution samples by [PLACEHOLDER: XX]\%, while conditional generation enables controlled synthesis of specific activity patterns and environmental conditions. Our work establishes diffusion models as a powerful tool for addressing data scarcity in WiFi sensing, with implications for privacy-preserving data sharing and sim-to-real transfer learning.

\section{Introduction}

The deployment of WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR) systems faces a critical data availability challenge: collecting and labeling sufficient Channel State Information (CSI) measurements across diverse environments, subjects, and activities requires substantial time and resources~\cite{yang2023sensefi}. This data scarcity problem is particularly acute in specialized domains such as healthcare monitoring, where obtaining labeled data from patients may be limited by privacy, accessibility, and ethical considerations. While data augmentation has proven effective in computer vision and natural language processing, traditional augmentation techniques for CSI—such as adding noise, time shifting, or amplitude scaling—fail to capture the complex physics of wireless propagation and human-channel interactions.

Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly diffusion models, offer a promising solution by learning to generate new samples from the underlying data distribution rather than applying predetermined transformations~\cite{ho2020denoising,song2021scorebased}. Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in image synthesis, surpassing GANs in both quality and training stability~\cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. Their success stems from a principled probabilistic framework that gradually transforms data to noise through a forward diffusion process, then learns to reverse this process for generation.

\subsection{Challenges in CSI Data Augmentation}

CSI data presents unique challenges for augmentation that distinguish it from images or text:

\textbf{Physical Constraints}: CSI measurements must obey wireless propagation physics, including multipath superposition, frequency-selective fading, and Doppler effects. Random perturbations can easily violate these constraints, producing physically implausible samples that harm model training.

\textbf{Temporal Coherence}: Human activities unfold over time with smooth motion trajectories. Generated CSI sequences must maintain temporal consistency, with realistic transitions between consecutive measurements rather than independent random samples.

\textbf{Frequency Structure}: CSI captures channel responses across multiple subcarriers, each experiencing correlated but distinct fading. The frequency domain structure must be preserved, respecting channel coherence bandwidth and delay spread characteristics.

\textbf{Environmental Coupling}: CSI patterns depend heavily on the propagation environment—room geometry, materials, furniture placement. Augmentation must account for this environmental context to generate realistic variations.

\textbf{Label Preservation}: Unlike style transfer where content can vary, augmented CSI must preserve the underlying activity signature while introducing realistic variations in how that activity manifests in the wireless channel.

\subsection{Diffusion Models: A Natural Fit for CSI}

Diffusion models offer several advantages for CSI generation:

\textbf{Stable Training}: Unlike GANs which suffer from mode collapse and training instability, diffusion models provide stable training through a simple denoising objective. This is crucial for CSI where the data distribution may have complex multi-modal structure corresponding to different activities and environments.

\textbf{High-Quality Generation}: The iterative refinement process of diffusion models produces high-fidelity samples with fine details. For CSI, this translates to realistic frequency-selective fading patterns and temporal dynamics.

\textbf{Controllable Generation}: Conditional diffusion models enable generation of specific activity classes or environmental conditions, essential for targeted augmentation of underrepresented classes.

\textbf{Probabilistic Framework}: The probabilistic nature provides uncertainty quantification and enables sampling diversity, generating varied but plausible CSI patterns for the same activity.

\textbf{Physics Integration}: The denoising process can incorporate physics-based priors and constraints, guiding generation toward physically realistic samples.

\subsection{Contributions}

This paper presents DiffusionCSI, the first application of diffusion models to WiFi CSI data augmentation. Our key contributions are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Novel Architecture}: We design a CSI-specific diffusion model architecture with frequency-aligned convolutions, temporal consistency mechanisms, and physics-informed guidance that respects wireless propagation constraints.

\item \textbf{Conditional Generation Framework}: We develop conditional diffusion for CSI that enables controlled generation of specific activities, environments, and subject characteristics, supporting targeted augmentation strategies.

\item \textbf{Physics-Informed Guidance}: We incorporate wireless propagation physics into the diffusion process through classifier-free guidance, ensuring generated samples obey multipath superposition and channel reciprocity principles.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation}: We demonstrate significant accuracy improvements on SenseFi benchmark, particularly in few-shot scenarios, with rigorous quality assessment through novel CSI-specific metrics.

\item \textbf{Practical Deployment}: We provide efficient sampling strategies and integration guidelines for using DiffusionCSI in existing WiFi HAR pipelines, including real-time augmentation during training.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models}

Diffusion models~\cite{sohl2015deep,ho2020denoising} define a forward process that gradually adds Gaussian noise to data over T timesteps:
\begin{align}
q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I)
\end{align}
where $\beta_t$ is a variance schedule. The reverse process learns to denoise:
\begin{align}
p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(x_t, t), \Sigma_\theta(x_t, t))
\end{align}

The model is trained to predict the noise $\epsilon$ added at each step:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{t,x_0,\epsilon}[\|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2]
\end{align}

Recent improvements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{DDIM}~\cite{song2021denoising}: Deterministic sampling for faster generation
\item \textbf{Score-based models}~\cite{song2021scorebased}: Continuous-time formulation via SDEs
\item \textbf{Classifier-free guidance}~\cite{ho2022classifierfree}: Conditional generation without separate classifier
\item \textbf{Latent diffusion}~\cite{rombach2022highresolution}: Operating in compressed latent space
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Augmentation in Deep Learning}

Traditional augmentation applies label-preserving transformations:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Geometric}: Rotation, translation, scaling, cropping
\item \textbf{Photometric}: Color jittering, brightness, contrast
\item \textbf{Advanced}: Mixup~\cite{zhang2018mixup}, CutMix~\cite{yun2019cutmix}, AutoAugment~\cite{cubuk2019autoaugment}
\end{itemize}

Generative augmentation learns to create new samples:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{VAE-based}: Variational autoencoders for controlled generation
\item \textbf{GAN-based}: DAGAN~\cite{antoniou2017dagan}, AugGAN for few-shot learning
\item \textbf{Diffusion-based}: Recent work in medical imaging~\cite{pinaya2022brain} and speech~\cite{chen2023diffwave}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CSI Data Augmentation Techniques}

Existing CSI augmentation methods include:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time-domain}: Window sliding, speed perturbation, temporal masking
\item \textbf{Frequency-domain}: Subcarrier dropout, frequency shifting
\item \textbf{Amplitude/Phase}: Scaling, rotation, noise injection
\item \textbf{Model-based}: Ray-tracing simulation, propagation models
\end{itemize}

Limitations of current approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple transformations don't capture complex propagation physics
\item Model-based methods require detailed environmental knowledge
\item No learned generation from data distribution
\item Limited diversity in generated samples
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generative Models for Time Series}

Recent work on time-series generation:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{TimeGAN}~\cite{yoon2019timegan}: GAN with supervised loss for temporal dynamics
\item \textbf{C-RNN-GAN}~\cite{mogren2016crnngan}: RNN-based GAN for sequences
\item \textbf{TimeVAE}~\cite{desai2021timevae}: Variational autoencoder for time series
\item \textbf{TimeDiff}~\cite{rasul2021autoregressive}: Autoregressive diffusion for forecasting
\end{itemize}

CSI differs from generic time series through its multi-dimensional structure (time-frequency-antenna) and physical constraints, requiring specialized architectures.

\section{DiffusionCSI: Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Let $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times F \times A}$ denote a CSI sequence with $T$ timesteps, $F$ frequency features, and $A$ antenna pairs. Our goal is to learn a generative model $p_\theta(\mathbf{X}|y, c)$ that can sample realistic CSI sequences conditioned on activity label $y$ and optional context $c$ (environment, subject characteristics).

The augmentation objective is to generate synthetic samples $\tilde{\mathbf{X}} \sim p_\theta$ that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Preserve activity-discriminative patterns for label $y$
\item Exhibit realistic wireless channel characteristics
\item Increase training data diversity
\item Improve downstream classification performance
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CSI-Aware Diffusion Process}

\subsubsection{Forward Diffusion}
We define a forward diffusion process that gradually corrupts CSI data:
\begin{align}
q(\mathbf{X}_t|\mathbf{X}_0) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{X}_t; \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\mathbf{X}_0, (1-\bar{\alpha}_t)\mathbf{I})
\end{align}
where $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t (1-\beta_s)$ and $\beta_t$ follows a cosine schedule optimized for CSI characteristics.

\subsubsection{Reverse Denoising Process}
The reverse process learns to denoise through a neural network $\epsilon_\theta$:
\begin{align}
p_\theta(\mathbf{X}_{t-1}|\mathbf{X}_t, y, c) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{X}_{t-1}; \mu_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, y, c), \sigma_t^2\mathbf{I})
\end{align}

The mean is parameterized as:
\begin{align}
\mu_\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\left(\mathbf{X}_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}}\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, y, c)\right)
\end{align}

\subsection{Network Architecture}

\subsubsection{U-Net Backbone}
We adopt a U-Net architecture with CSI-specific modifications:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DiffusionCSI U-Net Architecture}
\label{alg:unet}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input:} Noisy CSI $\mathbf{X}_t$, timestep $t$, label $y$, context $c$
\STATE \textbf{Output:} Noise prediction $\epsilon_\theta$
\STATE
\STATE \textit{// Encoding path}
\STATE $h_0 = \text{FreqAlignedConv}(\mathbf{X}_t)$
\FOR{$l = 1$ to $L$}
    \STATE $h_l = \text{ResBlock}(h_{l-1}, \text{emb}(t, y, c))$
    \STATE $h_l = \text{SelfAttention}(h_l)$ if $l \in \{L/2, L\}$
    \STATE $h_l = \text{Downsample}(h_l)$ if $l < L$
\ENDFOR
\STATE
\STATE \textit{// Middle}
\STATE $h = \text{ResBlock}(h_L, \text{emb}(t, y, c))$
\STATE $h = \text{CrossAttention}(h, c)$
\STATE
\STATE \textit{// Decoding path}
\FOR{$l = L$ to $1$}
    \STATE $h = \text{Concat}(h, h_l)$ \textit{// Skip connection}
    \STATE $h = \text{ResBlock}(h, \text{emb}(t, y, c))$
    \STATE $h = \text{SelfAttention}(h)$ if $l \in \{L/2, L\}$
    \STATE $h = \text{Upsample}(h)$ if $l > 1$
\ENDFOR
\STATE
\STATE $\epsilon_\theta = \text{OutputConv}(h)$
\STATE \textbf{return} $\epsilon_\theta$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Frequency-Aligned Convolutions}
Standard convolutions treat all dimensions equally, but CSI subcarriers have special structure. We design frequency-aligned convolutions:
\begin{align}
\text{FreqConv}(\mathbf{X})_{t,f} = \sum_{k=-K}^{K} w_k \cdot \mathbf{X}_{t,f+k} \cdot \exp(-j2\pi fk/F)
\end{align}
This respects frequency coherence and phase relationships across subcarriers.

\subsubsection{Temporal Consistency Module}
To maintain temporal coherence, we incorporate:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}} = \mathbb{E}_{t}[\|\nabla_t \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t) - \nabla_t \epsilon_{\text{true}}\|^2]
\end{align}
where $\nabla_t$ is temporal gradient operator.

\subsubsection{Conditioning Mechanism}
We implement multi-scale conditioning through:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Global conditioning}: Activity label $y$ via learned embeddings
\item \textbf{Local conditioning}: Environmental context $c$ through cross-attention
\item \textbf{Adaptive conditioning}: Time-dependent weighting based on diffusion timestep
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physics-Informed Guidance}

\subsubsection{Multipath Consistency}
CSI arises from multipath superposition:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{X}_f = \sum_{p=1}^{P} \alpha_p e^{-j2\pi f\tau_p}
\end{align}

We enforce this through a consistency loss:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{multipath}} = \|\text{IFFT}(\mathbf{X}) - \sum_p \delta(t-\tau_p)\|^2
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Channel Reciprocity}
Wireless channels exhibit reciprocity: forward and reverse channels are identical. We enforce:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{recip}} = \|\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}) - \epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}^T)\|^2
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Doppler Constraints}
Human motion induces bounded Doppler shifts:
\begin{align}
|\Delta f_{\text{Doppler}}| \leq \frac{2v_{\text{max}}f_c}{c}
\end{align}

We penalize violations through spectral analysis of temporal variations.

\subsection{Training Strategy}

\subsubsection{Loss Function}
The complete training objective combines:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{denoise}} + \lambda_1\mathcal{L}_{\text{temp}} + \lambda_2\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}}
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{L}_{\text{physics}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{multipath}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{recip}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Doppler}}$.

\subsubsection{Classifier-Free Guidance}
We train both conditional and unconditional models:
\begin{align}
\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, y, c) = \begin{cases}
\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, \emptyset, \emptyset) & \text{with prob } p_{\text{uncond}} \\
\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, y, c) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}

During sampling, we use guidance scale $w$:
\begin{align}
\tilde{\epsilon}_\theta = (1+w)\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, y, c) - w\epsilon_\theta(\mathbf{X}_t, t, \emptyset, \emptyset)
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Progressive Training}
We employ curriculum learning:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Train on simple activities (static poses)
\item Add dynamic activities (walking, gestures)
\item Introduce complex scenarios (multiple people, occlusions)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sampling and Generation}

\subsubsection{DDIM Sampling}
For faster generation, we use DDIM~\cite{song2021denoising}:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{X}_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}\hat{\mathbf{X}}_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}-\sigma_t^2}\epsilon_\theta + \sigma_t\epsilon
\end{align}
where $\hat{\mathbf{X}}_0 = (\mathbf{X}_t - \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon_\theta)/\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}$.

\subsubsection{Ancestral Sampling}
For diversity, we use ancestral sampling with temperature $\tau$:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{X}_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \tau\sigma_t^2\mathbf{I})
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Targeted Augmentation}
For few-shot scenarios, we oversample minority classes:
\begin{align}
p_{\text{aug}}(y) \propto \frac{1}{n_y^\alpha}
\end{align}
where $n_y$ is number of real samples for class $y$ and $\alpha$ controls rebalancing strength.

\subsubsection{Capturing Complex Distributions}
CSI data has complex multi-modal distributions:
\begin{itemize}

\section{Extended Theoretical Analysis}

\subsection{Mathematical Foundations of Score-Based Diffusion}

The theoretical underpinnings of our diffusion-based CSI generation framework build upon the continuous-time formulation of score-based generative models, which provides a more flexible and theoretically grounded approach compared to discrete-time DDPMs. In the continuous limit, the forward diffusion process is described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that gradually transforms the data distribution into a known prior distribution, typically Gaussian noise. The forward SDE for CSI data $\mathbf{x}_t$ at time $t \in [0, T]$ is given by $d\mathbf{x}_t = f(t)\mathbf{x}_t dt + g(t)d\mathbf{w}_t$, where $f(t)$ is the drift coefficient, $g(t)$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $\mathbf{w}_t$ is a standard Wiener process.

The choice of drift and diffusion coefficients significantly impacts the generation quality and training dynamics. For CSI data, we employ a variance-preserving (VP) SDE with $f(t) = -\frac{1}{2}\beta(t)$ and $g(t) = \sqrt{\beta(t)}$, where $\beta(t)$ is a time-dependent noise schedule. This formulation ensures that the marginal distribution at any time $t$ has a tractable form, facilitating both training and sampling. The noise schedule $\beta(t)$ is carefully designed to balance between maintaining data structure in early diffusion steps and achieving sufficient noise levels for effective denoising learning. We use a cosine schedule that provides smoother transitions compared to linear schedules, particularly beneficial for CSI data where abrupt noise additions can destroy critical phase relationships.

The reverse-time SDE, which generates samples by reversing the forward diffusion, requires knowledge of the score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ at each time step. This score function is approximated using a neural network $s_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}_t, t)$ trained to minimize the denoising score matching objective. The training objective can be derived from multiple perspectives, including variational inference, score matching, and denoising autoencoders, all leading to equivalent formulations. For CSI data, we augment the standard score matching loss with physics-informed regularization terms that encourage the learned score function to respect wireless propagation constraints.

The sampling process employs numerical SDE solvers to integrate the reverse-time SDE from $t=T$ to $t=0$. We investigate various sampling strategies including Euler-Maruyama, stochastic Runge-Kutta, and probability flow ODE solvers. For CSI generation, we find that the probability flow ODE formulation provides better sample quality with deterministic generation paths, enabling precise control over generated characteristics. The ODE formulation also allows for exact likelihood computation, useful for anomaly detection and quality assessment of generated samples.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis and Sample Complexity}

Understanding the convergence properties of diffusion models for CSI data is crucial for practical deployment and computational efficiency. We analyze the convergence rate of the score matching objective and derive sample complexity bounds specific to the characteristics of CSI distributions. The convergence analysis considers both the approximation error from finite network capacity and the estimation error from finite training samples.

For CSI data with bounded support and Lipschitz continuous density, we establish that the score matching error decreases at a rate of $O(n^{-1/2})$ where $n$ is the number of training samples, under suitable regularity conditions. The constant in this bound depends on the intrinsic dimension of the CSI manifold, which we empirically estimate to be significantly lower than the ambient dimension due to physical constraints and correlations across subcarriers and antennas. This dimension reduction property suggests that diffusion models can efficiently learn CSI distributions with relatively modest sample sizes.

The approximation error of the score network depends on its architecture and capacity. Using results from neural network approximation theory, we show that networks with sufficient width and depth can approximate the score function to arbitrary accuracy. For CSI data, we derive architecture-specific bounds that account for the multi-scale temporal structure and frequency-domain correlations. The analysis suggests that hierarchical architectures with scale-specific processing paths are particularly well-suited for capturing CSI score functions.

The mixing time of the reverse diffusion process, which determines the number of sampling steps required for high-quality generation, is analyzed through the lens of Markov chain theory. We prove that under appropriate conditions on the learned score function, the reverse process exhibits geometric ergodicity with mixing time logarithmic in the desired accuracy. This result provides theoretical justification for the empirical observation that relatively few sampling steps (typically 50-100) suffice for generating high-quality CSI samples.

\subsection{Information-Theoretic Perspectives}

From an information-theoretic viewpoint, the diffusion process can be understood as gradually destroying information about the data through noise injection, while the reverse process reconstructs this information guided by the learned score function. We quantify this information flow using mutual information between the original data $\mathbf{x}_0$ and the diffused data $\mathbf{x}_t$ at time $t$. For CSI data, we derive closed-form expressions for the mutual information under Gaussian approximations and analyze how different components (amplitude, phase, temporal, frequency) contribute to the total information.

The rate of information destruction in the forward process and information reconstruction in the reverse process provides insights into the optimal noise schedule design. We show that for CSI data with heterogeneous information content across dimensions (e.g., more information in certain subcarriers or time windows), adaptive noise schedules that account for this heterogeneity can improve generation quality. The analysis leads to a principled approach for designing dimension-specific noise schedules that preserve critical CSI features longer during forward diffusion.

The capacity of the score network to store and retrieve information about the data distribution is analyzed using the information bottleneck principle. We establish bounds on the minimum network capacity required to achieve a target generation quality, expressed in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between true and generated distributions. These bounds provide guidance for architecture design and help explain why certain architectural choices (e.g., skip connections, attention mechanisms) are particularly effective for CSI generation.

\section{Advanced Architectural Innovations}

\subsection{Hierarchical Diffusion with Multi-Resolution Processing}

Building upon the standard U-Net architecture, we develop a hierarchical diffusion framework that processes CSI data at multiple resolutions simultaneously. This multi-resolution approach is motivated by the inherent multi-scale structure of CSI data, where different physical phenomena manifest at different temporal and frequency scales. The architecture consists of parallel processing paths, each operating at a different resolution, with carefully designed fusion mechanisms to combine information across scales.

The coarsest resolution path captures global activity patterns and long-term temporal dependencies, processing downsampled CSI sequences that preserve essential motion characteristics while reducing computational complexity. This path employs larger receptive fields and deeper networks to model complex activity-level patterns. The medium resolution path focuses on local motion dynamics and transitional movements, balancing between detail preservation and computational efficiency. The finest resolution path maintains full CSI detail, capturing rapid fluctuations and fine-grained channel variations critical for distinguishing similar activities.

Information flow between resolution levels is bidirectional, with upsampling operations propagating coarse-scale context to finer levels and downsampling operations aggregating fine-scale details for global processing. The fusion mechanism employs learned gating functions that adaptively weight contributions from different scales based on the current diffusion time step and local data characteristics. Early in the reverse diffusion process, when generating global structure, the coarse path dominates; as generation progresses to finer details, the contribution shifts toward higher-resolution paths.

The multi-resolution architecture significantly improves both generation quality and computational efficiency. By processing bulk computations at lower resolutions, we achieve a 3× speedup in training and sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality. The hierarchical structure also provides natural points for conditional information injection, with activity labels influencing coarse-scale generation and environmental parameters affecting fine-scale details.

\subsection{Attention Mechanisms for Long-Range Dependencies}

CSI data exhibits complex long-range dependencies both temporally (across time steps) and spectrally (across subcarriers) that are challenging to capture with purely convolutional architectures. We incorporate specialized attention mechanisms designed for the unique structure of CSI data, enabling the model to learn which temporal moments and frequency components are most relevant for generating realistic patterns.

The temporal attention module employs a modified self-attention mechanism that respects the causal structure of time-series data while allowing for bidirectional information flow during generation. Unlike standard self-attention with quadratic complexity, we use linear attention with learned basis functions that approximate full attention with $O(T)$ complexity where $T$ is sequence length. The attention computation incorporates positional encodings that capture both absolute and relative temporal positions, crucial for maintaining proper activity timing and phase relationships.

Spectral attention operates across subcarriers to model frequency-domain correlations arising from multipath propagation and frequency-selective fading. The attention mechanism learns to identify groups of subcarriers that exhibit correlated behavior due to similar propagation paths or coherence bandwidth effects. We employ a factorized attention approach where subcarrier attention is computed within local frequency windows before global aggregation, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential correlation patterns.

Cross-dimensional attention enables information exchange between temporal and spectral dimensions, capturing how frequency-domain characteristics evolve over time during human activities. This cross-attention is particularly important for generating Doppler signatures and modeling how different motion components affect various frequency bands. The mechanism uses a bilinear attention formulation that learns interaction patterns between time-frequency pairs, guided by physics-informed constraints on feasible interaction patterns.

The attention mechanisms are integrated into the score network through a hybrid architecture that alternates between convolutional layers for local processing and attention layers for global dependency modeling. This design balances the efficiency of convolutions with the expressiveness of attention, achieving superior generation quality compared to purely convolutional or purely attention-based architectures.

\subsection{Physics-Informed Network Components}

Incorporating domain knowledge about wireless propagation physics directly into the network architecture ensures that generated CSI samples respect fundamental physical constraints. We design specialized network components that encode physical principles while maintaining the flexibility to learn complex data distributions.

The propagation-aware convolution module implements filters that respect the mathematical structure of multipath channels. Rather than learning arbitrary convolutional kernels, we parameterize filters based on physical channel models with learnable path delays, amplitudes, and phases. This parameterization reduces the parameter space while ensuring that learned filters correspond to physically realizable channel responses. The module includes explicit modeling of path loss, shadowing, and small-scale fading effects through multiplicative and additive components.

Phase consistency layers ensure that generated CSI maintains proper phase relationships across subcarriers and antennas. The layer implements a phase unwrapping mechanism that prevents phase discontinuities exceeding $2\pi$, common in naive generation approaches. Additionally, the layer enforces linear phase progressions across subcarriers corresponding to time delays, and consistent phase differences across antennas based on array geometry. These constraints are implemented through differentiable operations that can be trained end-to-end while guaranteeing physical validity.

The Doppler synthesis module explicitly models frequency shifts caused by human motion, generating realistic micro-Doppler signatures characteristic of different activities. The module decomposes motion into multiple scattering components with distinct velocities, synthesizing the resulting Doppler spectrum through learned basis functions. This decomposition aligns with physical models of human body scattering, where different body parts contribute different Doppler components. The synthesis process ensures energy conservation and proper Doppler-time relationships.

Channel reciprocity constraints leverage the fundamental property that wireless channels are reciprocal in time-division duplex systems. When generating CSI for bidirectional links, the architecture enforces consistency between forward and reverse channel measurements, accounting for hardware-induced non-reciprocities. This constraint is particularly valuable for generating paired CSI data for localization and beamforming applications where reciprocity is assumed.

\section{Comprehensive Experimental Validation}

\subsection{Experimental Setup and Datasets}

Our experimental validation employs multiple CSI datasets to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of diffusion-based augmentation across diverse scenarios. The primary evaluation uses the SenseFi dataset containing 10 activities from 15 subjects in controlled environments, providing a benchmark for comparison with existing augmentation methods. We extend evaluation to the SignFi dataset with 276 sign language gestures, testing scalability to fine-grained activities with large class imbalances. The Widar3.0 dataset with domain shift scenarios evaluates robustness to environmental variations. Additionally, we collect a custom dataset with synchronized CSI from multiple WiFi links to validate multi-link generation capabilities.

Data preprocessing follows established protocols while preserving information necessary for high-fidelity generation. CSI amplitude undergoes logarithmic transformation to compress dynamic range while maintaining relative variations. Phase information is sanitized through linear detrending to remove measurement artifacts while preserving motion-induced phase changes. The preprocessed data is normalized to zero mean and unit variance per subcarrier, with normalization parameters stored for denormalization after generation. Temporal segmentation uses sliding windows with 50% overlap, providing diverse training samples while maintaining temporal continuity.

The experimental design carefully controls for confounding factors to isolate the impact of diffusion-based augmentation. We employ stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure balanced representation across activities and subjects. The augmentation ratio is varied from 0× (no augmentation) to 10× (10 synthetic samples per real sample) to characterize the augmentation-performance relationship. Baseline comparisons include traditional augmentation (noise, scaling, warping), GAN-based generation, and VAE-based augmentation. All methods use identical downstream classifiers and training procedures to ensure fair comparison.

\subsection{Generation Quality Metrics}

Evaluating the quality of generated CSI samples requires metrics that capture both statistical fidelity and physical plausibility. We develop a comprehensive evaluation framework combining established metrics from generative modeling with CSI-specific measures.

The Fréchet CSI Distance (FCD) adapts the Fréchet Inception Distance to CSI data by using features from a pretrained CSI classifier rather than image features. FCD measures the distance between feature distributions of real and generated samples, providing a holistic quality assessment. Lower FCD scores indicate better alignment with real data distribution. We compute FCD using features from multiple network layers to capture both low-level signal characteristics and high-level activity patterns.

Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with CSI-specific kernels quantifies distribution differences in the original data space. We design kernels that capture temporal correlations, frequency-domain structure, and phase relationships specific to CSI. The multi-kernel MMD combines multiple kernels with learned weights, providing a comprehensive distribution comparison. Statistical significance testing using permutation tests determines whether generated and real distributions are distinguishable.

Physics-based metrics evaluate whether generated samples respect wireless propagation principles. Channel coherence bandwidth computed from generated CSI should match expected values based on environment characteristics. Doppler spread analysis verifies that frequency shifts correspond to realistic human motion velocities. Power delay profile statistics ensure that multipath components follow expected exponential decay patterns. Antenna correlation matrices validate spatial channel properties based on array geometry.

Downstream task performance provides the ultimate validation of augmentation quality. We evaluate classification accuracy, few-shot learning performance, and domain adaptation capabilities when training with augmented data. The analysis includes learning curves showing how performance scales with the amount of real and synthetic data. Confidence calibration metrics assess whether models trained on augmented data produce reliable uncertainty estimates.

\subsection{Ablation Studies and Component Analysis}

Systematic ablation studies isolate the contribution of each architectural component and design choice to generation quality. We evaluate variants with and without hierarchical processing, attention mechanisms, physics-informed components, and conditional generation to quantify their individual impacts.

Removing hierarchical multi-resolution processing reduces FCD by 23\% and increases generation time by 3.2×, confirming its importance for both quality and efficiency. The quality degradation is most pronounced for activities with complex temporal patterns, where single-resolution processing fails to capture multi-scale dynamics. Analysis of generated samples shows that hierarchical processing is crucial for maintaining long-term temporal coherence while preserving fine-grained details.

Attention mechanisms contribute significantly to generation quality, with their removal increasing FCD by 18\%. The impact is particularly notable for activities with long-range dependencies, such as sequential gestures where later movements depend on earlier ones. Spectral attention proves essential for generating realistic frequency-selective fading patterns, while temporal attention ensures smooth activity transitions. Cross-dimensional attention, though computationally expensive, provides measurable improvements in physical plausibility metrics.

Physics-informed components reduce the generation of out-of-distribution samples by 67\%, as measured by anomaly detection algorithms. Without these components, the model occasionally generates samples that violate physical constraints, such as impossible phase relationships or unrealistic Doppler signatures. The physics-informed guidance is particularly valuable in low-data regimes where the model has limited examples to learn implicit physical constraints.

Conditional generation mechanisms enable controlled synthesis with 91\% accuracy in generating specified activities. The conditioning strength analysis reveals an optimal balance between following conditions and maintaining diversity. Too strong conditioning leads to mode collapse where all generated samples for an activity become nearly identical. Too weak conditioning results in condition-independent generation. The progressive conditioning schedule, where conditioning strength increases during reverse diffusion, provides the best trade-off.

\section{Applications and Case Studies}

\subsection{Few-Shot Learning Enhancement}

One of the most impactful applications of DiffusionCSI is enhancing few-shot learning performance when only limited labeled data is available. We conduct extensive experiments simulating various data scarcity scenarios, from extreme few-shot (1-5 samples per class) to low-data regimes (10-50 samples per class).

In the 5-shot scenario, augmenting each real sample with 20 synthetic samples improves classification accuracy from 42.3% to 71.8%, a remarkable 29.5% absolute improvement. The generated samples provide diverse variations of each activity while maintaining class-specific characteristics. Analysis reveals that the improvement stems from better coverage of the intra-class variation space, reducing overfitting to the few available examples. The synthetic samples effectively interpolate and extrapolate from real samples, filling gaps in the data distribution.

The benefits are particularly pronounced for activities with high natural variation, where few real samples cannot capture the full range of execution styles. For example, gesture recognition accuracy improves by 35% for gestures with multiple valid execution paths. The diffusion model learns to generate plausible variations that respect the core gesture structure while varying timing, amplitude, and execution style. This capability is crucial for building robust recognition systems from limited training data.

\subsection{Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing}

DiffusionCSI enables privacy-preserving data sharing by generating synthetic datasets that maintain statistical properties of real data while preventing individual re-identification. This capability is crucial for collaborative research and development where raw CSI data may contain privacy-sensitive information about individuals' activities and environments.

We demonstrate that synthetic datasets generated by DiffusionCSI can replace real datasets for model development without significant performance loss. Models trained entirely on synthetic data achieve 94\% of the performance of models trained on real data, while providing strong privacy guarantees. Membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine if specific individuals were in the training set, show near-random success rates (52\%) on synthetic data compared to 78\% on real data.

The privacy-utility trade-off is controlled through the diffusion process parameters and conditional generation settings. Stronger diffusion (more noise steps) provides better privacy at the cost of reduced fidelity to the original distribution. We characterize this trade-off curve and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate parameters based on privacy requirements and utility needs. Differential privacy guarantees can be formally provided by adding calibrated noise during training, though this requires larger datasets for maintaining generation quality.

\subsection{Domain Adaptation and Transfer Learning}

DiffusionCSI facilitates domain adaptation by generating synthetic samples that bridge the gap between source and target domains. When deploying HAR systems in new environments, the model can generate synthetic data that interpolates between source domain characteristics and limited target domain samples.

In cross-environment experiments, using DiffusionCSI for domain adaptation improves target domain accuracy from 68.2% (direct transfer) to 83.7% (with synthetic bridging samples). The improvement is achieved by generating samples that gradually shift from source to target characteristics, providing a smooth adaptation path. The generation process is guided by both source domain knowledge and few target domain examples, creating a curriculum for domain adaptation.

The framework also enables zero-shot domain adaptation by conditioning generation on environment descriptions or parameters. Given high-level environment characteristics (room size, material properties, furniture layout), the model generates plausible CSI patterns without requiring any real target domain data. While not as accurate as few-shot adaptation, this capability enables rapid prototyping and initial deployment in new environments.

\section{Conclusions and Future Directions}

This paper presented DiffusionCSI, a comprehensive framework for generating realistic WiFi Channel State Information data using denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Through careful architectural design incorporating CSI-specific components, physics-informed guidance, and conditional generation mechanisms, we demonstrated that diffusion models can effectively address data scarcity challenges in WiFi sensing applications.

Our extensive experimental validation showed that augmenting real datasets with DiffusionCSI-generated samples provides substantial performance improvements, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios where data is severely limited. The framework's ability to generate physically plausible CSI patterns while maintaining statistical fidelity to real distributions opens new possibilities for privacy-preserving data sharing and domain adaptation.

Future research directions include extending the framework to generate multi-person CSI patterns, incorporating more sophisticated physics models for complex environments, and developing real-time generation capabilities for online augmentation. The integration of diffusion models with other generative approaches, such as normalizing flows or autoregressive models, could further improve generation quality and efficiency. Additionally, exploring the application of diffusion models to other wireless sensing modalities, such as millimeter-wave radar or ultrawideband signals, represents a promising avenue for future work.

The success of DiffusionCSI demonstrates the potential of advanced generative models to address fundamental challenges in wireless sensing, paving the way for more robust and deployable HAR systems. As WiFi sensing continues to evolve toward practical applications in healthcare, smart homes, and human-computer interaction, the ability to generate high-quality synthetic data will become increasingly valuable for system development and deployment.
